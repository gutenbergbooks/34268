<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p>This is not the lecture as it was delivered. Instead of two pages of
  letterpress and a woodcut, the reader may imagine that for half a minute
  the lecturer played with a spinning top or gyrostat, and occasionally
  ejaculated words of warning, admonition, and explanation towards his
  audience. A verbatim report would make rather uninteresting reading, and
  I have taken the liberty of trying, by greater fullness of explanation,
  to make up to the reader for his not having seen the moving apparatus. It
  has also been necessary in a treatise intended for general readers to
  simplify the reasoning, the lecture having been delivered to persons
  whose life experiences peculiarly fitted them for understanding
  scientific things. An "argument" has been added at the end to make the
  steps of the reasoning clearer.</p>

<h2>SPINNING TOPS.</h2>

<h2>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>

  <p>At a Leeds Board School last week, the master said to his class,
  "There is to be a meeting of the British Association in Leeds. What is it
  all about? Who are the members of the British Association? What do they
  do?" There was a long pause. At length it was broken by an intelligent
  shy boy: "Please, sir, I know&mdash;they spin tops!"<a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now I am sorry to say that this answer was wrong. The members of the
  British Association and the Operatives of Leeds have neglected
  top-spinning since they were ten years of age. If more attention were
  paid to the intelligent examination of the behaviour of tops, there would
  be greater advances in mechanical engineering and a great many
  industries. There would be a better general knowledge of astronomy.
  Geologists would not make mistakes by millions of years, and our
  knowledge of Light, and Radiant Heat, and other <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>Electro-magnetic
  Phenomena would extend much more rapidly than it does.</p>

  <p>I shall try to show you towards the end of the lecture that the fact
  of our earth's being a spinning body is one which would make itself known
  to us even if we lived in subterranean regions like the coming race of an
  ingenious novelist.<a name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> It is
  the greatest and most persistent cause of many of the phenomena which
  occur around us and beneath us, and it is probable that even Terrestrial
  Magnetism is almost altogether due to it. Indeed there is only one
  possible explanation of the <i>Vril-ya</i> ignorance about the earth's
  rotation. Their knowledge of mechanics and dynamics was immense; no
  member attending the meeting of the British Association can approach them
  in their knowledge of, I will not say, <i>Vril</i>, but even of quite
  vulgar electricity and magnetism; and yet this great race which expresses
  so strongly its contempt for Anglo-Saxon <i>Koom-Poshery</i> was actually
  ignorant of the fact that it had existed for untold generations inside an
  object that spins about an axis.</p>

  <p>Can we imagine for one instant that the children of that race had
  never spun a top or trundled a hoop, and so had had no chance of being
  led to the greatest study of nature? No; the only possible explanation
  lies in the great novelist's never <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>having done these things
  himself. He had probably as a child a contempt for the study of nature,
  he was a baby Pelham, and as a man he was condemned to remain in
  ignorance even of the powers of the new race that he had created.</p>

  <p>The <i>Vril-ya</i> ignorance of the behaviour of spinning bodies
  existing as it does side by side with their deep knowledge of magnetism,
  becomes even more remarkable when it comes home to us that the phenomena
  of magnetism and of light are certainly closely connected with the
  behaviour of spinning bodies, and indeed that a familiar knowledge of the
  behaviour of such bodies is absolutely necessary for a proper
  comprehension of most of the phenomena occurring in nature. The
  instinctive craving to investigate these phenomena seems to manifest
  itself soon after we are able to talk, and who knows how much of the
  intellectual inferiority of woman is due to her neglect of the study of
  spinning tops; but alas, even for boys in the pursuit of top-spinning,
  the youthful mind and muscle are left with no other guidance than that
  which is supplied by the experience of young and not very scientific
  companions. I remember distinctly that there were many puzzling problems
  presented to me every day. There were tops which nobody seemed able to
  spin, and there were others, well <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>prized objects, often
  studied in their behaviour and coveted as supremely valuable, that
  behaved well under the most unscientific treatment. And yet nobody, even
  the makers, seemed to know why one behaved badly and the other well.</p>

  <p>I do not disguise from myself the fact that it is rather a difficult
  task to talk of spinning tops to men who have long lost that skill which
  they wonder at in their children; that knowingness of touch and handling
  which gave them once so much power over what I fear to call inanimate
  nature. A problem which the child gives up as hopeless of solution, is
  seldom attacked again in maturer years; he drives his desire for
  knowledge into the obscure lumber-closets of his mind, and there it lies,
  with the accumulating dust of his life, a neglected and almost forgotten
  instinct. Some of you may think that this instinct only remains with
  those minds so many of which are childish even to the limit of life's
  span; and probably none of you have had the opportunity of seeing how the
  old dust rubs off from the life of the ordinary man, and the old desire
  comes back to him to understand the mysteries that surround him.</p>

  <p>But I have not only felt this desire myself, I have seen it in the
  excited eyes of the crowd of people who stand by the hour under the
  dropping cherry-blossoms beside the red-pillared temple of <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>Asakusa in the
  Eastern capital of Japan, watching the <i>tedzu-mashi</i> directing the
  evolutions of his heavily rimmed <i>Koma</i>. First he throws away from
  him his great top obliquely into the air and catches it spinning on the
  end of a stick, or the point of a sword, or any other convenient
  implement; he now sends it about quite carelessly, catching it as it
  comes back to him from all sorts of directions; he makes it run up the
  hand-rail of a staircase into a house by the door and out again by the
  window; he makes it travel up a great corkscrew. Now he seizes it in his
  hands, and with a few dexterous twists gives it a new stock of spinning
  energy. He makes it travel along a stretched string or the edge of a
  sword; he does all sorts of other curious things with his tops, and
  suddenly sinks from his masterful position to beg for a few coppers at
  the end of his performance.</p>

  <p>How tame all this must seem to you who more than half forget your
  childish initiation into the mysteries of nature; but trust me, if I
  could only make that old top-spinner perform those magical operations of
  his on this platform, the delight of the enjoyment of beautiful motion
  would come back. Perhaps it is only in Japan that such an exhibition is
  possible; the land where the waving bamboo, and the circling hawk, and
  the undulating summer sea, and every beautiful motion of nature <!-- Page
  14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>are looked
  upon with tenderness; and perhaps it is from Japan that we shall learn
  the development of our childish enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The devotees of the new emotional art of beautiful motion and changing
  colour are still in the main beggars like Homer, and they live in garrets
  like Johnson and Savage; but the dawn of a new era is heralded, or rather
  the dawn has already come, for Sir William Thomson's achievements in the
  study of spinning tops rank already as by no means the meanest of his
  great career.</p>

  <p>If you will only think of it, the behaviour of the commonest spinning
  top is very wonderful. When not spinning you see that it falls down at
  once, I find it impossible to balance it on its peg; but what a very
  different object it is when spinning; you see that it not only does not
  fall down, it offers a strange resistance when I strike it, and actually
  lifts itself more and more to an upright position. Once started on
  scientific observation, nature gives us facts of an analogous kind in
  great plenty.</p>

  <p>Those of you who have observed a rapidly moving heavy belt or rope,
  know that rapid motion gives a peculiar quasi-rigidity to flexible and
  even to fluid things.</p>

  <p>Here, for example, is a disc of quite thin paper (Fig. 1), and when I
  set it in rapid rotation you observe that it resists the force exerted by
  my <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>hand, the blow of my fist, as if it were a
  disc of steel. Hear how it resounds when I strike it with a stick. Where
  has its flexibility gone?</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">
      <a href="images/fig01.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig01.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 1" title="Fig. 1" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Here again is a ring of chain which is quite flexible. It seems
  ridiculous to imagine that this <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>could be made to stand up like a stiff hoop,
  and yet you observe that when I give it a rapid rotation on this mandril
  and let it slide off upon the table, it runs over the table just as if it
  were a rigid ring, and when it drops on the floor it rebounds like a
  boy's hoop (Fig. 2).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/fig02.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig02.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 2" title="Fig. 2" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Here again is a very soft hat, specially made for this sort of
  experiment. You will note that it collapses to the table in a shapeless
  mass when I lay it down, and seems quite incapable of resisting forces
  which tend to alter its shape. In fact, there is almost a complete
  absence of rigidity; but when this is spun on the end of a stick, first
  note <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>how it has taken a very easily defined
  shape; secondly, note how it runs along the table as if it were made of
  steel; thirdly, note how all at once it collapses again into a shapeless
  heap of soft material when its rapid motion has ceased. Even so you will
  see that when a drunken man is not leaning against a wall or lamp-post,
  he feels that his only chance of escape from ignominious collapse is to
  get up a decent rate of speed, to obtain a quasi-sobriety of demeanour by
  rapidity of motion.</p>

  <p>The water inside this glass vessel (Fig. 3) is in a state of rapid
  motion, revolving with the vessel itself. Now observe the piece of
  paraffin wax A immersed in the water, and you will see when I push at it
  with a rod that it vibrates just as if it were surrounded with a thick
  jelly. Let us now apply Prof. Fitzgerald's improvement on this experiment
  of Sir William Thomson's. Here is a disc B stuck on the end of the rod;
  observe that when I introduce it, although it does not touch A, A is
  repelled from the disc. Now observe that when I twirl the disc it seems
  to attract A.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:35%;">

  <p>At the round hole in front of this box a rapid motion is given to a
  small quantity of air which is mixed with smoke that you may see it. That
  smoke-ring moves through the air almost like a solid body for a
  considerable distance unchanged, and I am not sure that it may not be
  possible yet <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>to send as a projectile a huge poisoned
  smoke-ring, so that it may destroy or stupefy an army miles away.
  Remember that it is really the same air all the time. You will observe
  that two smoke rings sent from two boxes have curious actions <!-- Page
  19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>upon one
  another, and the study of these actions has given rise to Thomson's
  smoke-ring or vortex theory of the constitution of matter (Fig. 4).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:57%;">
      <a href="images/fig04.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig04.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 4" title="Fig. 4" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>
  </div>

  <p>It was Rankine, the great guide of all engineers, who first suggested
  the idea of molecular vortices in his explanations of heat phenomena and
  the phenomena of elasticity&mdash;the idea that every particle of matter
  is like a little spinning top; but I am now speaking of Thomson's theory.
  To imagine that an atom of matter is merely a <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>curiously shaped
  smoke-ring formed miraculously in a perfect fluid, and which can never
  undergo permanent alteration, looks to be a very curious and far-fetched
  hypothesis. But in spite of certain difficulties, it is the foundation of
  the theory which will best explain most of the molecular phenomena
  observed by philosophers. Whatever be the value of the theory, you see
  from these experiments that motion does give to small quantities of fluid
  curious properties of elasticity, attraction and repulsion; that each of
  these entities refuses to be cut in two; that you cannot bring a knife
  even near the smoke-ring; and that what may be called a collision between
  two of them is not very different in any way from the collision between
  two rings of india-rubber.</p>

  <p>Another example of the rigidity given to a fluid by rapid motion, is
  the feeling of utter helplessness which even the strongest swimmers
  sometimes experience when they get caught in an eddy underneath the
  water.</p>

  <p>I could, if I liked, multiply these instances of the quasi-rigidity
  which mere motion gives to flexible or fluid bodies. In Nevada a jet of
  water like the jet from a fireman's hose, except that it is much more
  rapid, which is nearly as easily projected in different directions, is
  used in mining, and huge masses of earth and rock are rapidly
  disintegrated <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>by the running water, which seems to be
  rather like a bar of steel than a jet of water in its rigidity.</p>

  <p>It is, however, probable that you will take more interest in this box
  of brass which I hold in my hands. You see nothing moving, but really,
  inside this case there is a fly-wheel revolving rapidly. Observe that I
  rest this case on the table on its sharp edge, a sort of skate, and it
  does not tumble down as an ordinary box would do, or as this box will do
  after a while, when its contents come to rest. Observe that I can strike
  it violent blows, and it does not seem to budge from its vertical
  position; it turns itself just a little round, but does not get tilted,
  however hard I strike it. Observe that if I do get it tilted a little it
  does not fall down, but slowly turns with what is called a precessional
  motion (Fig. 5).</p>

  <p>You will, I hope, allow me, all through this lecture, to use the term
  <i>precessional</i> for any motion of this kind. Probably you will object
  more strongly to the great liberty I shall take presently, of saying that
  the case <i>precesses</i> when it has this kind of motion; but I really
  have almost no option in the matter, as I must use some verb, and I have
  no time to invent a less barbarous one.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/fig05.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig05.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 5" title="Fig. 5" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>
  </div>

  <p>When I hold this box in my hands (Fig. 6), I find that if I move it
  with a motion of mere translation in any direction, it feels just as it
  would do <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>if its contents were at rest, but if I try
  to turn it in my hands I find the most curious great resistance to such a
  motion. The result is that when you hold this in your hands, its
  readiness to move so long as it is not turned round, and its great
  resistance to turning round, and its unexpected tendency to turn in a
  different way from that in which you try to turn it, give one the most
  uncanny sensations. It seems almost as if an invisible being had hold of
  the box and exercised forces capriciously. And <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>indeed there is a
  spiritual being inside, what the algebraic people call an impossible
  quantity, what other mathematicians call "an operator."</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/fig06.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig06.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Nearly all the experiments, even the tops and other apparatus you have
  seen or will see to-night, have been arranged and made by my enthusiastic
  assistant, Mr. Shepherd. The following experiment is not only his in
  arrangement; even the idea of it is his. He said, you may grin and
  contort your body with that large gyrostat in your hands, but many of
  your audience will simply say to <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>themselves that you only <i>pretend</i> to
  find a difficulty in turning the gyrostat. So he arranged this pivoted
  table for me to stand upon, and you will observe that when I now try to
  turn the gyrostat, it will not turn; however I may exert myself, it keeps
  pointing to that particular corner of the room, and all my efforts only
  result in turning round my own body and the table, but not the
  gyrostat.</p>

  <p>Now you will find that in every case this box only resists having the
  axis of revolution of its hidden flywheel turned round, and if you are
  interested in the matter and make a few observations, you will soon see
  that every spinning body like the fly-wheel inside this case resists more
  or less the change of direction of its spinning axis. When the fly-wheels
  of steam-engines and dynamo machines and other quick speed machines are
  rotating on board ship, you may be quite sure that they offer a greater
  resistance to the pitching or rolling or turning of the ship, or any
  other motion which tends to turn their axes in direction, than when they
  are not rotating.</p>

  <p>Here is a top lying on a plate, and I throw it up into the air; you
  will observe that its motion is very difficult to follow, and nobody
  could predict, before it falls, exactly how it will alight on the plate;
  it may come down peg-end foremost, or hindmost, or sideways. But when I
  spin it (Fig. 7), and now throw it up into the air, there is no doubt
  whatever <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>as to how it will come down. The spinning
  axis keeps parallel to itself, and I can throw the top up time after
  time, without disturbing much the spinning motion.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span>
  </div>

  <p>If I pitch up this biscuit, you will observe that I can have no
  certainty as to how it will come down, but if I give it a spin before it
  leaves my hand there is no doubt whatever (Fig. 8). Here is a hat. I
  throw it up, and I cannot be sure as to how it will move, but if I give
  it a spin, you see that, as <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>with the top and the biscuit, the axis about
  which the spinning takes place keeps parallel to itself, and we have
  perfect certainty as to the hat's alighting on the ground brim downwards
  (Fig. 9).</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span>
  </div>

  <p>I need not again bring before you the very soft hat to which we gave a
  quasi-rigidity a few minutes ago; but you will remember that my assistant
  sent that off like a projectile through the air when it was spinning, and
  that it kept its spinning axis parallel to itself just like this more
  rigid hat and the biscuit.</p>

  <p>I once showed some experiments on spinning tops to a coffee-drinking,
  tobacco-smoking audience in that most excellent institution, the Victoria
  Music Hall in London. In that music hall, things are not very different
  from what they are at any other <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>music hall except in beer, wine, and spirits
  being unobtainable, and in short scientific addresses being occasionally
  given. Now, I impressed my audience as strongly as I could with the above
  fact, that if one wants to throw a quoit with certainty as to how it will
  alight, one gives it a spin; if one wants to throw a hoop or a hat to
  somebody to catch upon a stick, one gives the hoop or hat a spin; the
  disinclination of a spinning body to let its axis get altered in
  direction can always be depended upon. I told them that this was why
  smooth-bore guns cannot be depended upon for accuracy;<a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> that the spin which an ordinary bullet
  took depended greatly on how it chanced to touch the muzzle as it just
  left the gun, whereas barrels are now rifled, that is, spiral grooves are
  now cut inside the barrel of a gun, and excrescences from the bullet or
  projectile fit into these grooves, so that as it is forced along the
  barrel of the gun by the explosive force of the powder, it must also spin
  about its axis. Hence it leaves the gun with a perfectly well-known
  spinning motion about which there can be no doubt, and we know too that
  Fig. 10 shows the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>kind of motion which it has afterwards, for,
  just like the hat or the biscuit, its spinning axis keeps nearly parallel
  to itself. Well, this was all I could do, for I am not skilful in
  throwing hats or quoits. But after my address was finished, and after a
  young lady in a spangled dress had sung a comic song, two jugglers came
  upon the stage, and I could not have had better illustrations of the
  above principle than were given in almost every trick performed by this
  lady and gentleman. They sent hats, and hoops, and plates, and umbrellas
  spinning from one to the other. One of them threw a stream of knives into
  the air, catching them and throwing them up again with perfect precision
  and my now educated audience shouted with delight, and showed in other
  unmistakable <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>ways that they observed the spin which that
  juggler gave to every knife as it left his hand, so that he might have a
  perfect knowledge as to how it would come back to him again (Fig. 11).
  <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>It
  struck me with astonishment at the time that, almost without exception,
  every juggling trick performed that evening was an illustration of the
  above principle. And now, if you doubt my statement, just ask a child
  whether its hoop is more likely to tumble down when it is rapidly rolling
  along, or when it is going very slowly; ask a man on a bicycle to go more
  and more slowly to see if he keeps his balance better; ask a
  ballet-dancer how long she could stand on one toe without balancing
  herself with her arms or a pole, if she were not spinning; ask
  astronomers how many months would elapse before the earth would point
  ever so far away from the pole star if it were not spinning; and above
  all, ask a boy whether his top is as likely to stand upright upon its peg
  when it is not spinning as when it is spinning.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:28%;">
      <a href="images/fig12.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig12.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 12" title="Fig. 12" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 12.</span>
  </div>

  <p>We will now examine more carefully the behaviour of this common top
  (Fig. 12). It is not <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>spinning, and you observe that it tumbles
  down at once; it is quite unstable if I leave it resting upright on its
  peg. But now note that when it is spinning, it not only will remain
  upright resting on its peg, but if I give it a blow and so disturb its
  state, it goes circling round with a precessional motion which grows
  gradually less and less as time goes on, and the top lifts itself to the
  upright position again. I hope you do not think that time spent in
  careful observation of a phenomenon of this kind is wasted. Educated
  observation of the commonest phenomena occurring in our everyday life is
  never wasted, and I often feel that if workmen, who are the persons most
  familiar with inorganic nature, could only observe and apply simple
  scientific laws to their observations, instead of a great discovery every
  century we should have a great discovery every year. Well, to return to
  our top; there are two very curious observations to make. Please neglect
  for a short time the slight wobbling motions that occur. One observation
  we make is, that the top does not at first bow down in the direction of
  the blow. If I strike towards the south, the top bows towards the west;
  if I strike towards the west, the top bows down towards the north. Now
  the reason of this is known to all scientific men, and the principle
  underlying the top's behaviour is of very great <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>importance in many ways,
  and I hope to make it clear to you. The second fact, that the top
  gradually reaches its upright position again, is one known to everybody,
  but the reason for it is not by any means well known, although I think
  that you will have no great difficulty in understanding it.</p>

  <p>The first phenomenon will be observed in this case which I have
  already shown you. This case (Fig. 5), <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>with the fly-wheel inside
  it, is called a <i>gyrostat</i>. When I push the case it does not bow
  down, but slowly turns round. This gyrostat will not exhibit the second
  phenomenon; it will not rise up again if I manage to get it out of its
  upright position, but, on the contrary, will go precessing in wider and
  wider circles, getting further and further away from its upright
  position.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:45%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>
  </div>

<div style="clear: both"></div>
  <p>The first phenomenon is most easily studied in this balanced gyrostat
  (Fig. 13). You here see the fly-wheel G in a strong brass frame F, which
  is supported so that it is free to move about the vertical axis A B, or
  about the horizontal axis C D. The gyrostat is balanced by a weight W.
  Observe that I can increase the leverage of W or diminish it by shifting
  the position of the sleeve at A so that it will tend to either lift or
  lower the gyrostat, or exactly balance it as it does now. You must
  observe exactly what it is that we wish to study. If I endeavour to push
  F downwards, with the end of this stick (Fig. 14), it really moves
  horizontally to the right; now I push it to the right (Fig. 15), and it
  only rises; now push it up, and you see that it goes to the left; push it
  to the left, and it only goes downwards. You will notice that if I clamp
  the instrument so that it cannot move vertically, it moves at once
  horizontally; if I prevent mere horizontal motion it readily moves
  vertically when I push it. Leaving it free as <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>before, I will now shift
  the position of the weight W, so that it tends continually to lift the
  gyrostat, and of course the instrument does not lift, it moves
  horizontally with a slow precessional motion. I now again shift the
  weight W, so that the gyrostat would fall if it were not spinning (Fig.
  16), and it now moves horizontally with a slow precessional motion which
  is in a direction opposed to the last. These phenomena are easily
  explained, but, <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>as I said before, it is necessary first to
  observe them carefully. You all know now, vaguely, the fundamental fact.
  It is that if I try to make a very quickly spinning body change the
  direction of its axis, the direction of the axis will change, but not in
  the way I intended. It is even more curious than my countryman's pig, for
  when he wanted the pig to go to Cork, he had to pretend that he was
  driving the pig home. His rule was a very <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span>simple one, and we must
  find a rule for our spinning body, which is rather like a crab, that will
  only go along the road when you push it sidewise.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of this, consider the spinning projectile of Fig.
  10. The spin tends to keep its axis always in the same direction. But
  there is a defect in the arrangement, which you are now in a <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>position to
  understand. You see that at A the air must be pressing upon the
  undersurface A A, and I have to explain that this pressure tends to make
  the projectile turn itself broadside on to the air. A boat in a current
  not allowed to move as a whole, but tied at its middle, sets itself
  broadside on to the current. Observe this disc of cardboard which I drop
  through the air edgewise, and note how quickly it sets itself broadside
  on and falls more slowly; and some of you may have thrown over into the
  water at Aden small pieces of silver for the diving boys, and you are
  aware that if it were not for this slow falling of the coins with a
  wobbling motion broadside on, it would be nearly impossible for any
  diving boy to get possession of them. Now all this is a parenthesis. The
  <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span>pressure of the air tends to make the
  projectile turn broadside on, but as the projectile is spinning it does
  not tilt up, no more than this gyrostat does when I try to tilt it up, it
  really tilts out of the plane of the diagram, out of the plane of its
  flight; and only that artillerymen know exactly what it will do, this
  kind of <i>windage</i> of the projectile would give them great
  trouble.</p>

  <p>You will notice that an experienced child when it wants to change the
  direction of a hoop, just exerts a tilting pressure with its hoop-stick.
  A man on a bicycle changes his direction by leaning over so as to be out
  of balance. It is well to remind you, however, that the motion of a
  bicycle and its rider is not all rotational, so that it is not altogether
  the analogue of a top or gyrostat. The explanation of the swerving from a
  straight path when the rider tilts his body, ultimately comes to the same
  simple principle, Newton's second law of motion, but it is arrived at
  more readily. It is for the same reason&mdash;put briefly, the exercise
  of a centripetal force&mdash;that when one is riding he can materially
  assist his horse to turn a corner quickly, if he does not mind
  appearances, by inclining his body towards the side to which he wants to
  turn; and the more slowly the horse is going the greater is the tendency
  to turn for a given amount of tilting of one's body. Circus-riders, when
  galloping in a circle, assist their horses greatly by the position of
  their bodies; it is <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>not to save themselves from falling by
  centrifugal force that they take a position on a horse's back which no
  riding-master would allow his pupil to imitate; and the respectable
  riders of this country would not scorn to help their horses in this way
  to quick turning movements, if they had to chase and collect cattle like
  American cowboys.</p>

  <p>Very good illustrations of change of direction are obtained in playing
  <i>bowls</i>. You know that a bowl, if it had no <i>bias</i>, that is, if
  it had no little weight inside it tending to tilt it, would roll along
  the level bowling-green in a straight path, its speed getting less and
  less till it stopped. As a matter of fact, however, you know that at the
  beginning, when it is moving fast, its path is pretty straight, but
  because it always has bias the path is never quite straight, and it bends
  more and more rapidly as the speed diminishes. In all our examples the
  slower the spin the quicker is the precession produced by given tilting
  forces.</p>

  <p>Now close observation will give you a simple rule about the behaviour
  of a gyrostat. As a matter of fact, all that has been incomprehensible or
  curious disappears at once, if instead of speaking of this gyrostat as
  moving up or down, or to the right or left, I speak of its motions about
  its various axes. It offers no resistance to mere motion of translation.
  But when I spoke of its moving <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>horizontally, I ought to have said that it
  moved about the vertical axis A B (Fig. 13). Again, what I referred to as
  up and down motion of F is really motion in a vertical plane about the
  horizontal axis C D. In future, when I speak of trying to give motion to
  F, think only of the axis about which I try to turn it, and then a little
  observation will clear the ground.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Here is a gyrostat (Fig. 17), suspended in gymbals so carefully that
  neither gravity nor any frictional forces at the pivots constrain it;
  nothing that I can do to this frame which I hold in my hand will affect
  the direction of the axis E F of the gyrostat. Observe that I whirl round
  on my toes like a ballet-dancer while this is in my hand. I move it about
  in all sorts of ways, but if it was pointing to the pole star at the
  beginning it remains pointing to the pole star; if it pointed towards the
  moon at the beginning it still points <!-- Page 41 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>{41}</span>towards the moon. The
  fact is, that as there is almost no frictional constraint at the pivots
  there are almost no forces tending to turn the axis of rotation of the
  gyrostat, and I can only give it motions of translation. But now I will
  clamp this vertical spindle by means of a screw and repeat my
  ballet-dance whirl; you will note that I need not whirl round, a very
  small portion of a whirl is enough to cause this gyrostat (Fig. 18) to
  set its spinning axis vertical, to set its axis parallel to the vertical
  axis of rotation which I give it. Now I whirl in the opposite direction,
  the gyrostat at once turns a somersault, turns completely round and
  remains again with its axis vertical, and if you were to carefully note
  the direction of the spinning of the <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>gyrostat, you would find
  the following rule to be generally true:&mdash;Pay no attention to mere
  translational motion, think only of rotation about axes, and just
  remember that when you constrain the axis of a spinning body to rotate,
  it will endeavour to set its own axis parallel to the new axis about
  which you rotate it; and not only is this the case, but it will endeavour
  to have the direction of its own spin the same as the direction of the
  new rotation. I again twirl on my toes, holding this frame, and now I
  know that to a person looking down upon the gyrostat and me from the
  ceiling, as I revolved in the direction of the hands of a clock, the
  gyrostat is spinning in the direction of the hands of a clock; but if I
  revolve against the clock direction (Fig. 19) the gyrostat tumbles over
  so as again to be revolving in the same direction as that in which I
  revolve.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig19.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig19.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 19" title="Fig. 19" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span>
  </div>

  <p>This then is the simple rule which will enable you to tell beforehand
  how a gyrostat will move <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>when you try to turn it in any particular
  direction. You have only to remember that if you continued your effort
  long enough, the spinning axis would become parallel to your new axis of
  motion, and the direction of spinning would be the same as the direction
  of your new turning motion.</p>

  <p>Now let me apply my rule to this balanced gyrostat. I shove it, or
  give it an impulse downwards, but observe that this really means a
  rotation about the horizontal axis C D (Fig. 13), and hence the gyrostat
  turns its axis as if it wanted to become parallel to C D. Thus, looking
  down from above (as shown by Fig. 20), O E was the direction of the
  spinning axis, O D was the axis about which I endeavoured to move it, and
  the instantaneous effect was that O E altered to the position O G. A
  greater impulse of the same kind would have caused the spinning axis
  instantly to go to O H or O J, whereas an upward opposite impulse would
  have instantly made the spinning axis point in the direction O K, O L or
  O M, depending on how great the impulse was and the rate of spinning.
  When one observes these phenomena for the first time, one says, "I shoved
  it down, and it moved to the right; I shoved it up, and it moved to the
  left;" but if the direction of the spin were opposite to what it is, one
  would say, "I shoved it down, and it moved to the left; I shoved it up,
  and it moved to the right." The simple <!-- Page 44 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>statement in all cases
  ought to be, "I wanted to rotate it about a new axis, and the effect was
  to send its spinning axis towards the direction of the new axis." And now
  if you play with this balanced gyrostat as I am doing, shoving it about
  in all sorts of ways, you will find the rule to be a correct one, and
  there is no difficulty in predicting what will happen.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">
      <a href="images/fig20.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig20.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 20" title="Fig. 20" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>If this rule is right, we see at once why precession takes place. I
  put this gyrostat (Fig. 13) out of balance, and if it were not rotating
  it would fall downwards; but a force acting downwards really causes the
  gyrostat to move to the right, and so you see that it is continually
  moving in this way, for the force is always acting downwards, and the
  spinning axis is continually chasing the new axes about which gravity
  tends continually to make it revolve. We see also why it is that if the
  want of balance is the other way, if gravity tends to lift the gyrostat,
  the precession is in the opposite direction. And in playing with this
  gyrostat as I do now, giving it all sorts of pushes, one makes other
  observations and sees that the above rule simplifies them all; that is,
  it enables us to remember them. For example, if I use this stick to hurry
  on the precession, the gyrostat moves in opposition to the force which
  causes the precession. I am particularly anxious that you should remember
  this. At present the balance-weight is so placed that the gyrostat would
  fall if it were not spinning. But it is spinning, and so it precesses. If
  gravity were greater it would precess faster, and it comes home to us
  that it is this precession which enables the force of gravity to be
  inoperative in mere downward motion. You see that if the precession is
  hurried, it is more than sufficient to balance gravity, <!-- Page 46
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>and the gyrostat
  rises. If I retard the precession, it is unable to balance gravity, and
  the gyrostat falls. If I clamp this vertical axis so that precession is
  impossible, you will notice that the gyrostat falls just as if it were
  not spinning. If I clamp the instrument so that it cannot move
  vertically, you notice how readily I can make it move horizontally; I can
  set it rotating horizontally like any ordinary body.</p>

  <p>In applying our rule to this top, observe that the axis of spinning is
  the axis E F of the top (Fig. 12). As seen in the figure, gravity is
  tending to make the top rotate about the axis F D, and the spinning axis
  in its chase of the axis F D describes a cone in space as it precesses.
  This gyrostat, which is top-heavy, rotates and precesses in much the same
  way as the top; that is, if you apply our rule, or use your observation,
  you will find that to an observer above the table the spinning and
  precession occur in the same direction, that is, either both with the
  hands of a watch, or both against the hands of a watch. Whereas, a top
  like this before you (Fig. 21), supported above its centre of gravity, or
  the gyrostat here (Fig. 22), which is also supported above its centre of
  gravity, or the gyrostat shown in Fig. 56, or any other gyrostat
  supported in such a way that it would be in stable equilibrium if it were
  not spinning; in all these <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span>cases, to an observer placed above the
  table, the precession is in a direction opposite to that of the
  spinning.</p>

<p><!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span></p>

  <p>If an impulse be given to a top or gyrostat in the direction of the
  precession, it will rise in opposition to the force of gravity, and
  should at any instant the precessional velocity be greater than what it
  ought to be for the balance of the force of gravity, the top or gyrostat
  will rise, its precessional velocity diminishing. If the precessional
  velocity is too small, the top will fall, and as it falls the
  precessional velocity increases.</p>

  <p>Now I say that all these facts, which are mere facts of observation,
  agree with our rule. I wish I dare ask you to remember them all. You will
  observe that in this wall sheet I have made a list of them. I speak of
  gravity as causing the precession, but the forces may be any others than
  such as are due to gravity.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Wall Sheet.</span></h3>

  <p>I. <span class="sc">Rule.</span> When forces act upon a spinning body,
  tending to cause rotation about any other axis than the spinning axis,
  the spinning axis sets itself in better agreement with the new axis of
  rotation. Perfect agreement would mean perfect parallelism, the
  directions of rotation being the same.</p>

  <p>II. Hurry on the precession, and the body rises in opposition to
  gravity. <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

  <p>III. Delay the precession and the body falls, as gravity would make it
  do if it were not spinning.</p>

  <p>IV. A common top precesses in the same direction as that in which it
  spins.</p>

  <p>V. A top supported above its centre of gravity, or a body which would
  be in stable equilibrium if not spinning, precesses in the opposite
  direction to that of its spinning.</p>

  <p>VI. The last two statements come to this:&mdash;When the forces acting
  on a spinning body tend to make the <i>angle</i> of precession greater,
  the precession is in the same direction as the spinning, and <i>vice
  versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>Having by observation obtained a rule, every natural philosopher tries
  to make his rule a rational one; tries to explain it. I hope you know
  what we mean when we say that we explain a phenomenon; we really mean
  that we show the phenomenon to be consistent with other better known
  phenomena. Thus when you unmask a spiritualist and show that the
  phenomena exhibited by him are due to mere sleight-of-hand and trickery,
  you explain the phenomena. When you show that they are all consistent
  with well-observed and established mesmeric influences, you are also said
  to explain the phenomena. When you show that they can be effected by
  means of telegraphic messages, or by reflection of light from mirrors,
  you explain the <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>phenomena, although in all these cases you
  do not really know the nature of mesmerism, electricity, light, or moral
  obliquity.</p>

  <p>The meanest kind of criticism is that of the man who cheapens a
  scientific explanation by saying that the very simplest facts of nature
  are unexplainable. Such a man prefers the chaotic and indiscriminate
  wonder of the savage to the reverence of a Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig23.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig23.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 23" title="Fig. 23" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 23.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The explanation of our rule is easy. Here is a gyrostat (Fig. 23)
  something like the earth in shape, and it is at rest. I am sorry to say
  that I am compelled to support this globe in a very visible manner by
  gymbal rings. If this globe were just floating in the air, if it had no
  tendency to fall, my explanation would be easier to understand, and I
  could illustrate it better experimentally. Observe the point P. If I move
  the globe slightly about the axis A, the point P moves to Q. But suppose
  instead of this that the globe and inner gymbal <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>ring had been moved about
  the axis B; the point P would have moved to R. Well, suppose both those
  rotations took place simultaneously. You all know that the point P would
  move neither to Q nor to R, but it would move to S; P S being the
  diagonal of the little parallelogram. The resultant motion then is
  neither about the axis O A in space, nor about the axis O B, but it is
  about some such axis as O C.</p>

  <p>To this globe I have given two rotations simultaneously. Suppose a
  little being to exist on this globe which could not see the gymbals, but
  was able to observe other objects in the room. It would say that the
  direction of rotation is neither about O A nor about O B, but that the
  real axis of its earth is some line intermediate, O C in fact.</p>

  <p>If then a ball is suddenly struck in two different directions at the
  same instant, to understand how it will spin we must first find how much
  spin each blow would produce if it acted alone, and about what axis. A
  spin of three turns per second about the axis O A (Fig. 24), and a spin
  of two turns per second about the axis O B, really mean that the ball
  will spin about the axis O C with a spin of three and a half turns per
  second. To arrive at this result, I made O A, 3 feet long (any other
  scale of representation would have been right) <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>and O B, 2 feet long, and
  I found the diagonal O C of the parallelogram shown on the figure to be
  3½ feet long.</p>

  <p>Observe that if the rotation about the axis O A is <i>with</i> the
  hands of a watch looking from O to A, the rotation about the axis O B
  looking from O to B, must also be with the hands of a watch, and the
  resultant rotation about the axis O C is also in a direction with the
  hands of a watch looking from O to C. Fig. 25 shows in two diagrams how
  necessary it is that on looking from O along either O A or O B, the
  rotation should be in the same direction as regards the hands of a watch.
  These constructions are well known to all who have studied elementary
  mechanical principles. Obviously if the rotation about O A is very much
  greater than the rotation about O B, then the position of the new axis O
  C must be much nearer O A than O B.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 25.</span>
  </div>

<div style="clear: both"></div>
  <p>We see then that if a body is spinning about an axis O A, and we apply
  forces to it which <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>would, if it were at rest, turn it about the
  axis O B; the effect is to cause the spinning axis to be altered to O C;
  that is, the spinning axis sets itself in better agreement with the new
  axis of rotation. This is the first statement on our wall sheet, the rule
  from which all our other statements are derived, assuming that they were
  not really derived from observation. Now I do not say that I have here
  given a complete proof for all cases, for the fly-wheels in these
  gyrostats are running in bearings, and the bearings constrain the axes to
  take the new positions, whereas there is no such <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>constraint in this top;
  but in the limited time of a popular lecture like this it is not
  possible, even if it were desirable, to give an exhaustive proof of such
  a universal rule as ours is. That I have not exhausted all that might be
  said on this subject will be evident from what follows.</p>

  <p>If we have a spinning ball and we give to it a new kind of rotation,
  what will happen? Suppose, for example, that the earth were a homogeneous
  sphere, and that there were suddenly impressed upon it a new rotatory
  motion tending to send Africa southwards; the axis of this new spin would
  have its pole at Java, and this spin combined with the old one would
  cause the earth to have its true pole somewhere between the present pole
  and Java. It would no longer rotate about its present axis. In fact the
  axis of rotation would be altered, and there would be no tendency for
  anything further to occur, because a homogeneous sphere will as readily
  rotate about one axis as another. But if such a thing were to happen to
  this earth of ours, which is not a sphere but a flattened spheroid like
  an orange, its polar diameter being the one-third of one per cent.
  shorter than the equatorial diameter; then as soon as the new axis was
  established, the axis of symmetry would resent the change and would try
  to become again the axis of rotation, and a great wobbling motion would
  ensue. <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>{55}</span>I put the matter in popular language when I
  speak of the resentment of an axis; perhaps it is better to explain more
  exactly what I mean. I am going to use the expression Centrifugal Force.
  Now there are captious critics who object to this term, but all engineers
  use it, and I like to use it, and our captious critics submit to all
  sorts of ignominious involution of language in evading the use of it. It
  means the force with which any body acts upon its constraints when it is
  constrained to move in a curved path. The force is always directed away
  from the centre of the curve. When a ball is whirled round in a curve at
  the end of a string its centrifugal force tends to break the string. When
  any body keyed to a shaft is revolving with the shaft, it may be that the
  centrifugal forces of all the parts just balance one another; but
  sometimes they do not, and then we say that the shaft is out of balance.
  Here, for example, is a disc of wood rotating. It is in balance. But I
  stop its motion and fix this piece of lead, A, to it, and you observe
  when it rotates that it is so much out of balance that the bearings of
  the shaft and the frame that holds them, and even the lecture-table, are
  shaking. Now I will put things in balance again by placing another piece
  of lead, B, on the side of the spindle remote from A, and when I again
  rotate the disc (Fig. 26) there <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>is no longer any shaking of the framework.
  When the crank-shaft of a locomotive has not been put in balance by means
  of weights suitably placed on the driving-wheels, there is nobody in the
  train who does not feel the effects. Yes, and the coal-bill shows the
  effects, for an unbalanced engine tugs the train spasmodically instead of
  exerting an efficient steady pull. My friend Professor Milne, of Japan,
  places earthquake measuring instruments on engines and in trains for
  measuring this and other wants of balance, and he has shown unmistakably
  that two engines of nearly the same general design, one balanced properly
  and the other not, consume very different amounts of coal in making the
  same journey at the same speed.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:27%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 26.</span>
  </div>

  <p>If a rotating body is in balance, not only does the axis of rotation
  pass through the centre of gravity (or rather centre of mass) of the
  body, but <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>the axis of rotation must be one of the
  three principal axes through the centre of mass of the body. Here, for
  example, is an ellipsoid of wood; A A, B B, and C C (Fig. 27) are its
  three principal axes, and it would be in balance if it rotated about any
  one of these three axes, and it would not be in balance if it rotated
  about any other axis, unless, indeed, it were like a homogeneous sphere,
  every diameter of which is a principal axis.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/fig27.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig27.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 27" title="Fig. 27" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 27.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Every body has three such principal axes through its centre of mass,
  and this body (Fig. 27) has them; but I have here constrained it to
  rotate about the axis D D, and you all observe the effect of the
  unbalanced centrifugal forces, which is nearly great enough to tear the
  framework in pieces. The higher the speed the more important this want of
  balance is. If the speed is doubled, the centrifugal forces become four
  times as great; and modern mechanical engineers with their quick speed
  engines, some of which revolve, like the fan-engines of torpedo-boats, at
  1700 revolutions per minute, require to pay great attention to this
  subject, which the older engineers never troubled their <!-- Page 58
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>heads about. You
  must remember that even when want of balance does not actually fracture
  the framework of an engine, it will shake everything, so that nuts and
  keys and other fastenings are pretty sure to get loose.</p>

  <p>I have seen, on a badly-balanced machine, a securely-fastened pair of
  nuts, one supposed to be locking the other, quietly revolving on their
  bolt at the same time, and gently lifting themselves at a regular but
  fairly rapid rate, until they both tumbled from the end of the bolt into
  my hand. If my hand had not been there, the bolts would have tumbled into
  a receptacle in which they would have produced interesting but most
  destructive phenomena. You would have somebody else lecturing to you
  to-night if that event had come off.</p>

  <p>Suppose, then, that our earth were spinning about any other axis than
  its present axis, the axis of figure. If spun about any diameter of the
  equator for example, centrifugal forces would just keep things in a state
  of unstable equilibrium, and no great change might be produced until some
  accidental cause effected a slight alteration in the spinning axis, and
  after that the earth would wobble very greatly. How long and how
  violently it would wobble, would depend on a number of circumstances
  about which I will not now venture to guess. If you <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span>tell me that on the
  whole, in spite of the violence of the wobbling, it would not get shaken
  into a new form altogether, then I know that in consequence of tidal and
  other friction it would eventually come to a quiet state of spinning
  about its present axis.</p>

  <p>You see, then, that although every body has three axes about which it
  will rotate in a balanced fashion without any tendency to wobble, this
  balance of the centrifugal forces is really an unstable balance in two
  out of the three cases, and there is only one axis about which a
  perfectly stable balanced kind of rotation will take place, and a
  spinning body generally comes to rotate about this axis in the long run
  if left to itself, and if there is friction to still the wobbling.</p>

  <p>To illustrate this, I have here a method of spinning bodies which
  enables them to choose as their spinning axis that one principal axis
  about which their rotation is most stable. The various bodies can be hung
  at the end of this string, and I cause the pulley from which the string
  hangs to rotate. Observe that at first the disc (Fig. 28 <i>a</i>)
  rotates soberly about the axis A A, but you note the small beginning of
  the wobble; now it gets quite violent, and now the disc is stably and
  smoothly rotating about the axis B B, which is the most important of its
  principal axes. <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:69%;">
      <a href="images/fig28.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig28.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 28" title="Fig. 28" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 28.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Again, this cone (Fig. 28 <i>b</i>) rotates smoothly at first about
  the axis A A, but the wobble begins and gets very great, and eventually
  the cone rotates smoothly about the axis B B, which is the most important
  of its principal axes. Here again is a rod hung from one end (Fig. 28
  <i>d</i>).</p>

  <p>See also this anchor ring. But you may be more interested in this limp
  ring of chain (Fig. 28 <i>c</i>). See how at first it hangs from the cord
  vertically, and how the wobbles and vibrations end in its becoming a
  perfectly circular ring lying all in a horizontal plane. This experiment
  illustrates also the quasi-rigidity given to a flexible body by rapid
  motion.</p>

  <p>To return to this balanced gyrostat of ours (Fig. 13). It is not
  precessing, so you know that the weight W just balances the gyrostat F.
  Now if I leave the instrument to itself after I give a downward impulse
  to F, not exerting merely a steady pressure, you will notice that F
  swings to the right for the reason already given; but it swings too fast
  and too far, just like any other swinging body, and it is easy from what
  I have already said, to see that this wobbling motion (Fig. 29) should be
  the result, and that it should continue until friction stills it, and F
  takes its permanent new position only after some time elapses.</p>

  <p>You see that I can impose this wobble or nodding <!-- Page 62 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>motion upon the gyrostat
  whether it has a motion of precession or not. It is now nodding as it
  processes round and round&mdash;that is, it is rising and falling as it
  precesses.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/fig29.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig29.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 29" title="Fig. 29" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 29.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps I had better put the matter a little more clearly. You see the
  same phenomenon in this top. If the top is precessing too fast for the
  force of gravity the top rises, and the precession diminishes in
  consequence; the precession being now too slow to balance gravity, the
  top falls a little and the <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>precession increases again, and this sort of
  vibration about a mean position goes on just as the vibration of a
  pendulum goes on till friction destroys it, and the top precesses more
  regularly in the mean position. This nodding is more evident in the
  nearly horizontal balanced gyrostat than in a top, because in a top the
  turning effect of gravity is less in the higher positions.</p>

  <p>When scientific men try to popularize their discoveries, for the sake
  of making some fact very plain they will often tell slight untruths,
  making statements which become rather misleading when their students
  reach the higher levels. Thus astronomers tell the public that the earth
  goes round the sun in an elliptic path, whereas the attractions of the
  planets cause the path to be only approximately elliptic; and
  electricians tell the public that electric energy is conveyed through
  wires, whereas it is really conveyed by all other space than that
  occupied by the wires. In this lecture I have to some small extent taken
  advantage of you in this way; for example, at first you will remember, I
  neglected the nodding or wobbling produced when an impulse is given to a
  top or gyrostat, and, all through, I neglect the fact that the
  instantaneous axis of rotation is only nearly coincident with the axis of
  figure of a precessing gyrostat or top. And indeed you may generally <!--
  Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>take it
  that if all one's statements were absolutely accurate, it would be
  necessary to use hundreds of technical terms and involved sentences with
  explanatory, police-like parentheses; and to listen to many such
  statements would be absolutely impossible, even for a scientific man. You
  would hardly expect, however, that so great a scientific man as the late
  Professor Rankine, when he was seized with the poetic fervour, would err
  even more than the popular lecturer in making his accuracy of statement
  subservient to the exigencies of the rhyme as well as to the necessity
  for simplicity of statement. He in his poem, <i>The Mathematician in
  Love</i>, has the following lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The lady loved dancing;&mdash;he therefore applied</p>
      <p class="i2">To the polka and waltz, an equation;</p>
      <p>But when to rotate on his axis he tried,</p>
      <p>His centre of gravity swayed to one side,</p>
      <p class="i2">And he fell by the earth's gravitation."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now I have no doubt that this is as good "dropping into poetry" as can
  be expected in a scientific man, and &mdash;&mdash;'s science is as good
  as can be expected in a man who calls himself a poet; but in both cases
  we have illustrations of the incompatibility of science and rhyming.</p>

  <p>The motion of this gyrostat can be made even more complicated than it
  was when we had <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>nutation and precession, but there is really
  nothing in it which is not readily explainable by the simple principles I
  have put before you. Look, for example, at this well-balanced gyrostat
  (Fig. 17). When I strike this inner gymbal ring in any way you see that
  it wriggles quickly just as if it were a lump of jelly, its rapid
  vibrations dying away just like the rapid vibrations of any yielding
  elastic body. This strange elasticity is of very great interest when we
  consider it in relation to the molecular properties of matter. Here again
  (Fig. 30) we have an example which is even more interesting. I have
  supported the cased <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>gyrostat of Figs. 5 and 6 upon a pair of
  stilts, and you will observe that it is moving about a perfectly stable
  position with a very curious staggering kind of vibratory motion; but
  there is nothing in these motions, however curious, that you cannot
  easily explain if you have followed me so far.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/fig30.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig30.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 30.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Some of you who are more observant than the others, will have remarked
  that all these precessing gyrostats gradually fall lower and lower, just
  as they would do, only more quickly, if they were not spinning. And if
  you cast your eye upon the third statement of our wall sheet (p. <a
  href="#page49">49</a>) you will readily understand why it is so.</p>

  <p>"Delay the precession and the body falls, as gravity would make it do
  if it were not spinning." <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>Well, the precession of every one of these
  is resisted by friction, and so they fall lower and lower.</p>

  <p>I wonder if any of you have followed me so well as to know already why
  a spinning top rises. Perhaps you have not yet had time to think it out,
  but I have accentuated several times the particular fact which explains
  this phenomenon. Friction makes the gyrostats fall, what is it that
  causes a top to rise? Rapid rising to the upright position is the
  invariable sign of rapid rotation in a top, and I recollect that when
  quite vertical we used to say, "She sleeps!" Such was the endearing way
  in which the youthful experimenter thought of the beautiful object of his
  tender regard.</p>

  <p>All so well known as this rising tendency of a top has been ever since
  tops were first spun, I question if any person in this hall knows the
  explanation, and I question its being known to more than a few persons
  anywhere. Any great mathematician will tell you that the explanation is
  surely to be found published in <i>Routh</i>, or that at all events he
  knows men at Cambridge who surely know it, and he thinks that he himself
  must have known it, although he has now forgotten those elaborate
  mathematical demonstrations which he once exercised his mind upon. I
  believe that all such statements are made in error, but I cannot <!--
  Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>be
  sure.<a name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> A partial theory of
  the phenomenon was given by Mr. Archibald Smith in the <i>Cambridge
  Mathematical Journal</i> many years ago, but the problem was solved by
  Sir William Thomson and Professor Blackburn when they stayed together one
  year at the seaside, reading for the great Cambridge mathematical
  examination. It must have alarmed a person interested in Thomson's
  success to notice that the seaside holiday was really spent by him and
  his friend in spinning all sorts of rounded stones which they picked up
  on the beach.</p>

  <p>And I will now show you the curious phenomenon that puzzled him that
  year. This ellipsoid (Fig. 31) will represent a waterworn stone. It is
  lying in its most stable state on the table, and I give it a spin. You
  see that for a second or two it was inclined to go on spinning about the
  axis A A, but it began to wobble violently, and after a while, when these
  wobbles stilled, you saw that it was spinning nicely with its axis B B
  vertical; but then a new series of wobblings began and became more
  violent, and when they ceased you saw that the object had at length
  reached a settled state of <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>spinning, standing upright upon its longest
  axis. This is an extraordinary phenomenon to any person who knows about
  the great inclination of this body to spin in the very way in which I
  first started it spinning. You will find that nearly any rounded stone
  when spun will get up in this way upon its longest axis, if the spin is
  only vigorous enough, and in the very same way this spinning top tends to
  get more and more upright.</p>

  <p>I believe that there are very few mathematical explanations of
  phenomena which may not be given in quite ordinary language to people who
  have an ordinary amount of experience. In most cases the symbolical
  algebraic explanation must be given first by somebody, and then comes the
  time for its translation into ordinary language. This is the foundation
  of the new thing called Technical Education, which assumes that a <!--
  Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>workman
  may be taught the principles underlying the operations which go on in his
  trade, if we base our explanations on the experience which the man has
  acquired already, without tiring him with a four years' course of study
  in elementary things such as is most suitable for inexperienced children
  and youths at public schools and the universities.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 33.</span>
  </div>

  <p>With your present experience the explanation of the rising of the top
  becomes ridiculously simple. If you look at statement <i>two</i> on this
  wall sheet (p. 48) and reflect a little, some of you will be able,
  without any elaborate mathematics, to give the simple reason for this
  that Thomson gave me sixteen years ago. "Hurry on the precession, and the
  body rises in opposition to gravity." Well, as I am not touching the top,
  and as the body does rise, we look at once for something that is hurrying
  on the precession, and we naturally look to the way in which its peg is
  rubbing on the table, for, with the exception of the atmosphere this top
  is touching nothing else than the table. Observe carefully how any of
  these objects precesses. Fig. 32 shows the way in which a top spins.
  Looked at from above, if the top is spinning in the direction of the
  hands of a watch, we know from the fourth statement of our wall sheet, or
  by mere observation, that it also precesses in the direction of the hands
  <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>{71}</span>of
  a watch; that is, its precession is such as to make the peg roll at B
  into the paper. For you will observe that the peg is rolling round a
  circular path on the table, G being nearly motionless, and the axis A G A
  describing nearly a cone in space whose vertex is G, above the table.
  Fig. 33 <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>shows the peg enlarged, and it is evident
  that the point B touching the table is really like the bottom of a wheel
  B B', and as this wheel is rotating, the rotation causes it to roll
  <i>into</i> the paper, away from us. But observe that its mere precession
  is making it roll <i>into</i> the paper, and that the spin if great
  enough wants to roll the top faster than the precession lets it roll, so
  that it hurries on the precession, and therefore the top rises. That is
  the simple explanation; the spin, so long as it is <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>great enough, is always
  hurrying on the precession, and if you will cast your recollection back
  to the days of your youth, when a top was supported on your hand as this
  is now on mine (Fig. 34), and the spin had grown to be quite small, and
  was unable to keep the top upright, you will remember that you
  dexterously helped the precession by giving your hand a circling motion
  so as to get from your top the advantages as to uprightness of a slightly
  longer spin.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig34.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig34.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 34" title="Fig. 34" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 34.</span>
  </div>

  <p>I must ask you now by observation, and the application of exactly the
  same argument, to explain the struggle for uprightness on its longer axis
  of any rounded stone when it spins on a table. I may tell you that some
  of these large rounded-looking objects which I now spin before you in
  illustration, are made hollow, and they are either of wood or zinc,
  because I have not the skill necessary to spin large solid objects, and
  yet I wanted to have objects which you would be able to see. This small
  one (Fig. 31) is the largest solid one to which my fingers are able to
  give sufficient spin. Here is a very interesting object (Fig. 35),
  spherical <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>in shape, but its centre of gravity is not
  exactly at its centre of figure, so when I lay it on the table it always
  gets to its position of stable equilibrium, the white spot touching the
  table as at A. Some of you know that if this sphere is thrown into the
  air it seems to have very curious motions, because one is so apt to
  forget that it is the motion of its centre of gravity which follows a
  simple path, and the boundary is eccentric to the centre of gravity. Its
  motions when set to roll upon a carpet are also extremely curious.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:32%;">
      <a href="images/fig35.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig35.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 35" title="Fig. 35" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 35.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Now for the very reasons that I have already given, when this sphere
  is made to spin on the table, it always endeavours to get its white spot
  uppermost, as in C, Fig. 35; to get into the position in which when not
  spinning it would be unstable.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:69%;">
      <a href="images/fig36.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig36.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 36" title="Fig. 36" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The precession of a top or gyrostat leads us at once to think of the
  precession of the great spinning body on which we live. You know that the
  earth <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>spins on its axis a little more than once
  every twenty-four hours, as this orange is revolving, and that it goes
  round the sun once in a year, as this orange is now going round a model
  sun, or as is shown in the diagram (Fig. 36). Its spinning axis points in
  the direction shown, very nearly to the star which is called the pole
  star, almost infinitely far away. In the figure and model I have greatly
  exaggerated the elliptic nature of the earth's path, as is quite usual,
  although it may be a little misleading, because the earth's path is much
  more nearly circular than many people imagine. As a matter of fact the
  earth is about three million miles nearer the sun in winter than it is in
  summer. This seems at first paradoxical, but we get to understand it when
  we reflect that, because of the slope of the earth's axis to the
  ecliptic, we people who live in the northern hemisphere have the sun less
  vertically above us, and have a shorter day in the winter, and hence each
  square foot of our part of the earth's surface receives much less heat
  every day, and so we feel colder. Now in about 13,000 years the earth
  will have precessed just half a revolution (<i>see</i> Fig. 38); the axis
  will then be sloped towards the sun when it is nearest, instead of away
  from it as it is now; consequently we shall be much warmer in summer and
  colder in winter than we are now. Indeed we shall then be much worse off
  than the southern <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>hemisphere people are now, for they have
  plenty of oceanic water to temper their climate. It is easy to see the
  nature of the change from figures 36, 37, and 38, or from the model as I
  carry the orange and its symbolic knitting-needle round the model sun.
  Let us imagine an observer placed above this model, far above the north
  pole of the earth. He sees the earth rotating against the direction of
  the hands of a watch, and he finds that it precesses with the hands of a
  watch, so that spin and precession are in opposite directions. Indeed it
  is because of this that we have the word "precession," which we now apply
  to the motion of a top, although the precession of a top is in the same
  direction as that of the spin.</p>

  <p>The practical astronomer, in explaining the <i>luni-solar precession
  of the equinoxes</i> to you, will not probably refer to tops or
  gyrostats. He will tell you that the <i>longitude</i> and <i>right
  ascension</i> of a star seem to alter; in fact that the point on the
  ecliptic from which he makes his measurements, namely, the spring
  equinox, is slowly travelling round the ecliptic in a direction opposite
  to that of the earth in its orbit, or to the apparent path of the sun.
  The spring equinox is to him for heavenly measurements what the longitude
  of Greenwich is to the navigator. He will tell you that aberration of
  light, and parallax of the stars, <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>but more than both, this
  precession of the equinoxes, are the three most important things which
  prevent us from seeing in an observatory by transit observations of the
  stars, that the earth is revolving with perfect uniformity. But his way
  of describing the precession must not disguise for you the physical fact
  that his phenomenon and ours are identical, and that to us who are
  acquainted with spinning tops, the slow conical motion of a spinning axis
  is more readily understood than those details of his measurements in
  which an astronomer's mind is bound up, and which so often condemn a man
  of great intellectual power to the life of drudgery which we generally
  associate with the idea of the pound-a-week cheap clerk.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/fig22.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig22.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 22" title="Fig. 22" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The precession of the earth is then of the same nature as that of a
  gyrostat suspended above its centre of gravity, of a body which would be
  stable and not top-heavy if it were not spinning. In fact the precession
  of the earth is of the same nature as that of this large gyrostat (Fig.
  22), which is suspended in gymbals, so that it has a vibration like a
  pendulum when not spinning. I will now spin it, so that looked at from
  above it goes against the hands of a watch, and you observe that it
  precesses with the hands of a watch. Here again is a hemispherical wooden
  ship, in which there is a gyrostat with its axis vertical. It is in
  stable <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>equilibrium. When the gyrostat is not
  spinning, the ship vibrates slowly when put out of equilibrium; when the
  gyrostat is spinning the ship gets a motion of precession which is
  opposite in direction to that of the spinning. Astronomers, beginning
  with Hipparchus, have made observations of the earth's motion for us, and
  we have observed the motions of gyrostats, and we naturally seek for an
  explanation of the precessional motion of the earth. The equator of the
  earth makes an angle of 23½° with the ecliptic, which is the plane of the
  earth's orbit. Or the spinning axis of the earth is always at angle of
  23½° with a perpendicular to the ecliptic, and makes a complete
  revolution in 26,000 years. The surface of the water on which this wooden
  ship is floating represents the ecliptic. The axis <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span>of spinning of the
  gyrostat is about 23½° to the vertical; the precession is in two minutes
  instead of 26,000 years; and only that this ship does not revolve in a
  great circular path, we should have in its precession a pretty exact
  illustration of the earth's precession.</p>

  <p>The precessional motion of the ship, or of the gyrostat (Fig. 22), is
  explainable, and in the same way the earth's precession is at once
  explained if we find that there are forces from external bodies tending
  to put its spinning axis at right angles to the ecliptic. The earth is a
  nearly spherical body. If it were exactly spherical and homogeneous, the
  resultant force of attraction upon it, of a distant body, would be in a
  line through its centre. And again, if it were spherical and
  non-homogeneous, but if its mass were arranged in uniformly dense,
  spherical layers, like the coats of an onion. But the earth is not
  spherical, and to find what is the nature of the attraction of a distant
  body, it has been necessary to make pendulum observations all over the
  earth. You know that if a pendulum does not alter in length as we take it
  about to various places, its time of vibration at each place enables the
  force of gravity at each place to be determined; and Mr. Green proved
  that if we know the force of gravity at all places on the surface of the
  earth, although we may know nothing about the <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>state of the inside of
  the earth, we can calculate with absolute accuracy the force exerted by
  the earth on matter placed anywhere outside the earth; for instance, at
  any part of the moon's orbit, or at the sun. And hence we know the equal
  and opposite force with which such matter will act on the earth. Now
  pendulum observations have been made at a great many places on the earth,
  and we know, although of course not with absolute accuracy, the
  attraction on the earth, of matter outside the earth. For instance, we
  know that the resultant attraction of the sun on the earth is a force
  which does not pass through the centre of the earth's mass. You may
  comprehend the result better if I refer to this diagram of the earth at
  midwinter (Fig. 39), and use a popular method of description. A and B may
  roughly be called the protuberant parts of the earth&mdash;that
  protuberant belt of matter which makes the <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>earth orange-shaped
  instead of spherical. On the spherical portion inside, assumed roughly to
  be homogeneous, the resultant attraction is a force through the
  centre.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:67%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 39.</span>

  <p>I will now consider the attraction on the protuberant equatorial belt
  indicated by A and B. The sun attracts a pound of matter at B more than
  it attracts a pound of matter at A, because B is nearer than A, and hence
  the total resultant force is in the direction M N rather than O O,
  through the centre of the earth's mass. But we know that a force in the
  direction M N is equivalent to a force O O parallel to M N, together with
  a tilting couple of forces tending to turn the equator edge on to the
  sun. You will get the true result as to the tilting tendency by imagining
  the earth to be motionless, and the sun's mass to be distributed as a
  circular ring of matter 184 millions of miles in diameter, inclined to
  the equator at 23½°. Under the influence of the attraction of this ring
  the earth would heave like a great ship on a calm sea, rolling very
  slowly; in fact, making one complete swing in about three years. But the
  earth is spinning, and the tilting couple or torque acts upon it just
  like the forces which are always tending to cause this ship-model to
  stand upright, and hence it has a precessional motion whose complete
  period is 26,000 years. When there is no spin in the ship, its complete
  oscillation takes place in three seconds, and <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>when I spin the gyrostat
  on board the ship, the complete period of its precession is two minutes.
  In both cases the effect of the spin is to convert what would be an
  oscillation into a very much slower precession.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a great difference between the earth and the
  gyrostat. The forces acting on the top are always the same, but the
  forces acting on the earth are continually altering. At midwinter and
  midsummer the tilting forces are greatest, and at the equinoxes in spring
  and autumn there are no such forces. So that the precessional motion
  changes its rate every quarter year from a maximum to nothing, or from
  nothing to a maximum. It is, however, always in the same
  direction&mdash;the direction opposed to the earth's spin. When we speak
  then of the precessional motion of the earth, we usually think of the
  mean or average motion, since the motion gets quicker and slower every
  quarter year.</p>

  <p>Further, the moon is like the sun in its action. It tries to tilt the
  equatorial part of the earth into the plane of the moon's orbit. The
  plane of the moon's orbit is nearly the same as that of the ecliptic, and
  hence the average precession of the earth is of much the same kind as if
  only one of the two, the moon or the sun, alone acted. That is, the
  general phenomenon of precession of the <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>earth's axis in a conical
  path in 26,000 years is the effect of the combined tilting actions of the
  sun and moon.</p>

  <p>You will observe here an instance of the sort of untruth which it is
  almost imperative to tell in explaining natural phenomena. Hitherto I had
  spoken only of the sun as producing precession of the earth. This was
  convenient, because the plane of the ecliptic makes always almost exactly
  23½° with the earth's equator, and although on the whole the moon's
  action is nearly identical with that of the sun, and about twice as
  great, yet it varies considerably. The superior tilting action of the
  moon, just like its tide-producing action, is due to its being so much
  nearer us than the sun, and exists in spite of the very small mass of the
  moon as compared with that of the sun.</p>

  <p>As the ecliptic makes an angle of 23½° with the earth's equator, and
  the moon's orbit makes an angle 5½° with the ecliptic, we see that the
  moon's orbit sometimes makes an angle of 29° with the earth's equator,
  and sometimes only 18°, changing from 29° to 18°, and back to 29° again
  in about nineteen years. This causes what is called "Nutation," or the
  nodding of the earth, for the tilting action due to the sun is greatly
  helped and greatly modified by it. The result of the variable nature of
  the moon's action is then that the earth's axis <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>rotates in an elliptic
  conical path round what might be called its mean position. We have also
  to remember that twice in every lunar month the moon's tilting action on
  the earth is greater, and twice it is zero, and that it continually
  varies in value.</p>

  <p>On the whole, then, the moon and sun, and to a small extent the
  planets, produce the general effect of a precession, which repeats itself
  in a period of about 25,695 years. It is not perfectly uniform, being
  performed at a speed which is a maximum in summer and winter; that is,
  there is a change of speed whose period is half a year; and there is a
  change of speed whose period is half a lunar month, the precession being
  quicker to-night than it will be next Saturday, when it will increase for
  about another week, and diminish the next. Besides this, because of 5½°
  of angularity of the orbits, we have something like the nodding of our
  precessing gyrostat, and the inclination of the earth's axis to the
  ecliptic is not constant at 23½°, but is changing, its periodic time
  being nineteen years. Regarding the earth's centre as fixed at O we see
  then, as illustrated in this model and in Fig. 40, the axis of the earth
  describes almost a perfect circle on the celestial sphere once in 25,866
  years, its speed fluctuating every half year and every half month. But it
  is not a perfect circle, it is really a wavy <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>line, there being a
  complete wave every nineteen years, and there are smaller ripples in it,
  corresponding to the half-yearly and fortnightly periods. But the very
  cause of the nutation, the nineteen-yearly period of retrogression of the
  moon's nodes, as it is called, is itself really produced as the
  precession of a gyrostat is produced, that is, by tilting forces acting
  on a spinning body.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 40.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Imagine the earth to be stationary, and the sun and moon revolving
  round it. It was Gauss who found that the present action is the same as
  if the masses of the moon and sun were distributed all <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>round their
  orbits. For instance, imagine the moon's mass distributed over her orbit
  in the form of a rigid ring of 480,000 miles diameter, and imagine less
  of it to exist where the present speed is greater, so that the ring would
  be thicker at the moon's apogee, and thinner at the perigee. Such a ring
  round the earth would be similar to Saturn's rings, which have also a
  precession of nodes, only Saturn's rings are not rigid, else there would
  be no equilibrium. Now if we leave out of account the earth and imagine
  this ring to exist by itself, and that its centre simply had a motion
  round the sun in a year, since it makes an angle of 5½° with the ecliptic
  it would vibrate into the ecliptic till it made the same angle on the
  other side and back again. But it revolves once about its centre in
  twenty-seven solar days, eight hours, and it will no longer swing like a
  ship in a ground-swell, but will get a motion of precession opposed in
  direction to its own revolution. As the ring's motion is against the
  hands of a watch, looking from the north down on the ecliptic, this
  retrogression of the moon's nodes is in the direction of the hands of a
  watch. It is exactly the same sort of phenomenon as the precession of the
  equinoxes, only with a much shorter period of 6798 days instead of 25,866
  years.</p>

  <p>I told you how, if we knew the moon's mass or the sun's, we could tell
  the amount of the forces, or <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>the torque as it is more properly called,
  with which it tries to tilt the earth. We know the rate at which the
  earth is spinning, and we have observed the precessional motion. Now when
  we follow up the method which I have sketched already, we find that the
  precessional velocity of a spinning body ought to be equal to the torque
  divided by the spinning velocity and by the moment of inertia<a
  name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of the body about the polar
  axis. Hence the greater the tilting forces, and the less the spin and the
  less the moment of inertia, the greater is the precessional speed. Given
  all of these elements except one, it is easy to calculate that unknown
  element. Usually what we aim at in such a calculation is the
  determination of the moon's mass, as this phenomenon of precession and
  the action of the tides are the only two natural phenomena which have as
  yet enabled the moon's mass to be calculated.</p>

  <p>I do not mean to apologize to you for the introduction of such terms
  as <i>Moment of Inertia</i>, nor do I mean to explain them. In this
  lecture I have avoided, as much as I could, the introduction of
  mathematical expressions and the use of technical terms. But I want you
  to <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>understand that I am not afraid to introduce
  technical terms when giving a popular lecture. If there is any offence in
  such a practice, it must, in my opinion, be greatly aggravated by the
  addition of explanations of the precise meanings of such terms. The use
  of a correct technical term serves several useful purposes. First, it
  gives some satisfaction to the lecturer, as it enables him to state, very
  concisely, something which satisfies his own weak inclination to have his
  reasoning complete, but which he luckily has not time to trouble his
  audience with. Second, it corrects the universal belief of all popular
  audiences that they know everything now that can be said on the subject.
  Third, it teaches everybody, including the lecturer, that there is
  nothing lost and often a great deal gained by the adoption of a casual
  method of skipping when one is working up a new subject.</p>

  <p>Some years ago it was argued that if the earth were a shell filled
  with liquid, if this liquid were quite frictionless, then the moment of
  inertia of the shell is all <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'that that'."
  >that</span> we should have to take into account in considering
  precession, and that if it were viscous the precession would very soon
  disappear altogether. To illustrate the effect of the moment of inertia,
  I have hung up here a number of glasses&mdash;one <i>a</i> filled with
  sand, another <i>b</i> with treacle, a third <i>c</i> with oil, the
  fourth <i>d</i> with water, <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:69%;">
      <a href="images/fig41.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig41.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 41" title="Fig. 41" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 41.</span>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span></p>

  <p>and the fifth <i>e</i> is empty (Fig. 41). You see that if I twist
  these suspending wires and release them, a vibratory motion is set up,
  just like that of the balance of a watch. Observe that the glass with
  water vibrates quickly, its effective moment of inertia being merely that
  of the glass itself, and you see that the time of swing is pretty much
  the same as that of the empty glass; that is, the water does not seem to
  move with the glass. Observe that the vibration goes on for a fairly long
  time.</p>

  <p>The glass with sand vibrates slowly; here there is great moment of
  inertia, as the sand and glass behave like one rigid body, and again the
  vibration goes on for a long time.</p>

  <p>In the oil and treacle, however, there are longer periods of vibration
  than in the case of the water or empty glass, and less than would be the
  case if the vibrating bodies were all rigid, but the vibrations are
  stilled more rapidly because of friction.</p>

  <p>Boiled (<i>f</i>) and unboiled (<i>g</i>) eggs suspended from wires in
  the same way will exhibit the same differences in the behaviour of
  bodies, one of which is rigid and the other liquid inside; you see how
  much slower an oscillation the boiled has than the unboiled.</p>

  <p>Even on the table here it is easy to show the difference between
  boiled and unboiled eggs. <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>Roll them both; you see that one of them
  stops much sooner than the other; it is the unboiled one that stops
  sooner, because of its internal friction.</p>

  <p>I must ask you to observe carefully the following very distinctive
  test of whether an egg is boiled or not. I roll the egg or spin it, and
  then place my finger on it just for an instant; long enough to stop the
  motion of the shell. You see that the boiled egg had quite finished its
  motion, but the unboiled egg's shell alone was stopped; the liquid inside
  goes on moving, and now renews the motion of the shell when I take my
  finger away.</p>

  <p>It was argued that if the earth were fluid inside, the effective
  moment of inertia of the shell being comparatively small, and having, as
  we see in these examples, nothing whatever to do with the moment of
  inertia of the liquid, the precessional motion of the earth ought to be
  enormously quicker than it is. This was used as an argument against the
  idea of the earth's being fluid inside.</p>

  <p>We know that the observed half-yearly and half-monthly changes of the
  precession of the earth would be much greater than they are if the earth
  were a rigid shell containing much liquid, and if the shell were not
  nearly infinitely rigid the phenomena of the tides would not occur, but
  in regard to the general precession of the earth there is now <!-- Page
  95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>no doubt that
  the old line of argument was wrong. Even if the earth were liquid inside,
  it spins so rapidly that it would behave like a rigid body in regard to
  such a slow phenomenon as precession of the equinoxes. In fact, in the
  older line of argument the important fact was lost sight of, that rapid
  rotation can give to even liquids a quasi-rigidity. Now here (Fig. 42
  <i>a</i>) is a hollow brass top filled with water. The frame is light,
  and the water inside has much more mass than the outside frame, and if
  you test this carefully you will find that the top spins in almost
  exactly the same way as if the water were quite rigid; in fact, as if the
  whole top were rigid. Here you see it spinning and precessing just like
  any rigid top. This top, I know, is not filled with water, it is only
  partially filled; but whether partially or wholly filled it spins very
  much like a rigid top.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/fig42.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig42.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 42.</span>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span></p>

  <p>This is not the case with a long hollow brass top with water inside. I
  told you that all bodies have one axis about which they prefer to rotate.
  The outside metal part of a top behaves in a way that is now well known
  to you; the friction of its peg on the table compels it to get up on its
  longer axis. But the fluid inside a top is not constrained to spin on its
  longer axis of figure, and as it prefers its shorter axis like all these
  bodies I showed you, it spins in its own way, and by friction and
  pressure against the case constrains the case to spin about the shorter
  axis, annulling completely the tendency of the outside part to rise or
  keep up on its long axis. Hence it is found to be simply impossible to
  spin a long hollow top when filled with water.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/fig44.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig44.jpg"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 44.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="figright" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/fig43.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig43.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 43" title="Fig. 43" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 43.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Here, for example, is one (Fig. 42 <i>b</i>) that only differs from
  the last in being longer. It is filled, or partially filled, with water,
  and you observe that if <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>I slowly get up a great spin when it is
  mounted in this frame, and I let it out on the table as I did the other
  one, this one lies down at once and refuses to spin on its peg. This
  difference of behaviour is most remarkable in the two hollow tops you see
  before you (Fig. 43). They are both nearly spherical, both filled with
  water. They look so nearly alike that few persons among the audience are
  able to detect any difference in their shape. But one of them (<i>a</i>)
  is really slightly oblate like an orange, and the other (<i>b</i>) is
  slightly prolate like a lemon. I will give them both a gradually
  increasing rotation in this frame <!-- Page 98 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>(Fig. 44) for a time
  sufficient to insure the rotation of the water inside. When just about to
  be set free to move like ordinary tops on the table, water and brass are
  moving like the parts of a rigid top. You see that the orange-shaped one
  continues to spin and precess, and gets itself upright when disturbed,
  like an ordinary rigid top; indeed I have seldom seen a better behaved
  top; whereas the lemon-shaped one lies down on its side at once, and
  quickly ceases to move in any way.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/fig45.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig45.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 45" title="Fig. 45" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span>
  </div>

  <p>And now you will be able to appreciate a fourth test of a boiled egg,
  which is much more easily seen by a large audience than the last. Here is
  the unboiled one (Fig. 45 <i>b</i>). I try my best to spin it as it lies
  on the table, but you see that I cannot give it much spin, and so there
  is nothing of any importance to look at. But you observe that it is quite
  easy to spin the boiled <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>egg, and that for reasons now well known to
  you it behaves like the stones that Thomson spun on the sea-beach; it
  gets up on its longer axis, a very pretty object for our educated eyes to
  look at (Fig. 45 <i>a</i>). You are all aware, from the behaviour of the
  lemon-shaped top, that even if, by the use of a whirling table suddenly
  stopped, or by any other contrivance, I could get up a spin in this
  unboiled egg, it would never make the slightest effort to rise on its end
  and spin about its longer axis.</p>

  <p>I hope you don't think that I have been speaking too long about
  astronomical matters, for there is one other important thing connected
  with astronomy that I must speak of. You see, I have had almost nothing
  practically to do with astronomy, and hence I have a strong interest in
  the subject. It is very curious, but quite true, that men practically
  engaged in any pursuit are almost unable to see the romance of it. This
  is what the imaginative outsider sees. But the overworked astronomer has
  a different point of view. As soon as it becomes one's duty to do a
  thing, and it is part of one's every-day work, the thing loses a great
  deal of its interest. We have been told by a great American philosopher
  that the only coachmen who ever saw the romance of coach-driving are
  those titled individuals who pay nowadays so largely for the <!-- Page
  100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>privilege.
  In almost any branch of engineering you will find that if any invention
  is made it is made by an outsider; by some one who comes to the study of
  the subject with a fresh mind. Who ever heard of an old inhabitant of
  Japan or Peru writing an interesting book about those countries? At the
  end of two years' residence he sees only the most familiar things when he
  takes his walks abroad, and he feels unmitigated contempt for the
  ingenuous globe-trotter who writes a book about the country after a
  month's travel over the most beaten tracks in it. Now the experienced
  astronomer has forgotten the difficulties of his predecessors and the
  doubts of outsiders. It is a long time since he felt that awe in gazing
  at a starry sky that we outsiders feel when we learn of the sizes and
  distances apart of the hosts of heaven. He speaks quite coolly of
  millions of years, and is nearly as callous when he refers to the ancient
  history of humanity on our planet as a weather-beaten geologist. The
  reason is obvious. Most of you know that the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> is
  as a literary production one of the most uninteresting works of reference
  in existence. It is even more disconnected than a dictionary, and I
  should think that preparing census-tables must be ever so much more
  romantic as an occupation than preparing the tables of the <i>Nautical
  Almanac</i>. And yet <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>a particular figure, one of millions set
  down by an overworked calculator, may have all the tragic importance of
  life or death to the crew and passengers of a ship, when it is heading
  for safety or heading for the rocks under the mandate of that single
  printed character.</p>

  <p>But this may not be a fair sort of criticism. I so seldom deal with
  astronomical matters, I know so little of the wear and tear and monotony
  of the every-day life of the astronomer, that I do not even know that the
  above facts are specially true about astronomers. I only know that they
  are very likely to be true because they are true of other professional
  men.</p>

  <p>I am happy to say that I come in contact with all sorts and conditions
  of men, and among others, with some men who deny many of the things
  taught in our earliest school-books. For example, that the earth is
  round, or that the earth revolves, or that Frenchmen speak a language
  different from ours. Now no man who has been to sea will deny the
  roundness of the earth, however greatly he may wonder at it; and no man
  who has been to France will deny that the French language is different
  from ours; but many men who learnt about the rotation of the earth in
  their school-days, and have had a plentiful opportunity of observing the
  heavenly bodies, deny the rotation of the earth. <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>They tell you that the
  stars and moon are revolving about the earth, for they see them revolving
  night after night, and the sun revolves about the earth, for they see it
  do so every day. And really if you think of it, it is not so easy to
  prove the revolution of the earth. By the help of good telescopes and the
  electric telegraph or good chronometers, it is easy to show from the want
  of parallax in stars that they must be very far away; but after all, we
  only know that either the earth revolves or else the sky revolves.<a
  name="NtA8" href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Of course, it seems infinitely
  more likely that the small earth should revolve than that the whole
  heavenly host should turn about the earth as a centre, and infinite
  likelihood is really absolute proof. Yet there is nobody who does not
  welcome an independent kind of proof. The phenomena of the tides, and
  nearly every new astronomical fact, may be said to be an addition to the
  proof. Still there is the absence of perfect certainty, and when we are
  told that these spinning-top phenomena give us a real proof of the
  rotation of the earth without our leaving the room, we welcome <!-- Page
  103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>it, even
  although we may sneer at it as unnecessary after we have obtained it.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">
      <a href="images/fig17.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig17.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 17" title="Fig. 17" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span>
  </div>

  <p>You know that a gyrostat suspended with perfect freedom about axes,
  which all pass through its centre of gravity, maintains a constant
  direction in space however its support may be carried. Its axis is not
  forced to alter its direction in any way. Now this gyrostat (Fig. 17) has
  not the perfect absence of friction at its axes of which I speak, and
  even the slightest friction will produce some constraint which is
  injurious to the experiment I am about to describe. It must be
  remembered, that if there were absolutely no constraint, then, even if
  the <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>gyrostat were <i>not</i> spinning, its
  axis would keep a constant direction in space. But the spinning gyrostat
  shows its superiority in this, that any constraint due to friction is
  less powerful in altering the axis. The greater the spin, then, the
  better able are we to disregard effects due to friction. You have seen
  for yourselves the effect of carrying this gyrostat about in all sorts of
  ways&mdash;first, when it is not spinning and friction causes quite a
  large departure from constancy of direction of the axis; second, when it
  is spinning, and you see that although there is now the same friction as
  before, and I try to disturb the instrument more than before, the axis
  remains sensibly parallel to itself all the time. Now when this
  instrument is supported by the table it is really being carried round by
  the earth in its daily rotation. If the axis kept its direction
  perfectly, and it were now pointing horizontally due east, six hours
  after this it will point towards the north, but inclining downwards, six
  hours afterwards it will point due west horizontally, and after one
  revolution of the earth it will again point as it does now. Suppose I try
  the experiment, and I see that it points due east now in this room, and
  after a time it points due west, and yet I know that the gyrostat is
  constantly pointing in the same direction in space all the time, surely
  it is obvious that the room must <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>be turning round in
  space. Suppose it points to the pole star now, in six hours, or twelve,
  or eighteen, or twenty-four, it will still point to the pole star.</p>

  <p>Now it is not easy to obtain so frictionless a gyrostat that it will
  maintain a good spin for such a length of time as will enable the
  rotation of the room to be made visible to an audience. But I will
  describe to you how forty years ago it was proved in a laboratory that
  the earth turns on its axis. This experiment is usually connected with
  the name of Foucault, the same philosopher who with Fizeau showed how in
  a laboratory we can measure the velocity of light, and therefore measure
  the distance of the sun. It was suggested by Mr. Lang of Edinburgh in
  1836, although only carried out in 1852 by Foucault. By these
  experiments, if you were placed on a body from which you could see no
  stars or other outside objects, say that you were living in underground
  regions, you could discover&mdash;first, whether there is a motion of
  rotation, and the amount of it; second, the meridian line or the
  direction of the true north; third, your latitude. Obtain a gyrostat like
  this (Fig. 46) but much larger, and far more frictionlessly suspended, so
  that it is free to move vertically or horizontally. For the vertical
  motion your gymbal pivots ought to be hard steel knife-edges. <!-- Page
  106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span></p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 46.</span>

  <p>As for the horizontal freedom, Foucault used a fine steel wire. Let
  there be a fine scale engraved crosswise on the outer gymbal ring, and
  try to discover if it moves horizontally by means of a microscope with
  cross wires. When this is carefully done we find that there is a motion,
  <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>but this is not the motion of the
  gyrostat, it is the motion of the microscope. In fact, the microscope and
  all other objects in the room are going round the gyrostat frame.</p>

  <p>Now let us consider what occurs. The room is rotating about the
  earth's axis, and we know the rate of rotation; but we only want to know
  for our present purpose how much of the total rotation is about a
  vertical line in the room. If the room were at the North Pole, the whole
  rotation would be about the vertical line. If the room were at the
  equator, none of its rotation would be about a vertical line. In our
  latitude now, the horizontal rate of rotation about a vertical axis is
  about four-fifths of the whole rate of rotation of the earth on its axis,
  and this is the amount that would be measured by our microscope. This
  experiment would give no result at a place on the equator, but in our
  latitude you would have a laboratory proof of the rotation of the earth.
  Foucault made the measurements with great accuracy.</p>

  <p>If you now clamp the frame, and allow the spinning axis to have no
  motion except in a horizontal plane, the motion which the earth tends to
  give it about a vertical axis cannot now affect the gyrostat, but the
  earth constrains it to move about an axis due north and south, and
  consequently the spinning axis tries to put itself parallel <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>to the north
  and south direction (Fig. 47). Hence with such an instrument it is easy
  to find the true north. If there were absolutely no friction the
  instrument would vibrate about the true north position like the compass
  needle (Fig. 50), although with an exceedingly slow swing.</p>

  <p>It is with a curious mixture of feelings that one first recognizes the
  fact that all rotating bodies, fly-wheels of steam-engines and the like,
  are always tending to turn themselves towards the pole star; gently and
  vainly tugging at their foundations <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>to get round towards
  the object of their adoration all the time they are in motion.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 48.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Now we have found the meridian as in Fig. 47, we can begin a third
  experiment. Prevent motion horizontally, that is, about a vertical axis,
  but give the instrument freedom to move vertically in the meridian, like
  a transit instrument in an observatory <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>about its horizontal
  axis. Its revolution with the earth will tend to make it change its
  angular position, and therefore it places itself parallel to the earth's
  axis; when in this position the daily rotation no longer causes any
  change in its direction in space, so it continues to point to the pole
  star (Fig. 48). It would be an interesting experiment to measure with a
  delicate chemical balance the force with which the axis raises itself,
  and in this way <i>weigh</i> the rotational motion of the earth.<a
  name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now let us turn the frame of the instrument G B round a right angle,
  so that the spinning axis can only move in a plane at right angles to the
  meridian; obviously it is constrained by the vertical component of the
  earth's rotation, and points vertically downwards.</p>

  <p>This last as well as the other phenomena of which I have spoken is
  very suggestive. Here is a magnetic needle (Fig. 49), sometimes called a
  dipping needle from the way in which it is suspended. If I turn its <!--
  Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>frame
  so that it can only move at right angles to the meridian, you see that it
  points vertically. You may reflect upon the analogous properties of this
  magnetic needle (Fig. 50) and of the gyrostat (Fig. 47); they both, when
  only capable of moving horizontally, point to the north; and you see that
  a very frictionless gyrostat might be used as a compass, or at all events
  as a corrector of compasses.<a name="NtA10"
  href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> I have just put before you another
  analogy, and I want you to understand that, although these are only
  analogies, they are not mere chance analogies, for there is undoubtedly a
  dynamical connection between the magnetic and the gyrostatic phenomena.
  Magnetism depends on rotatory motion. The molecules of matter are in
  actual rotation, and a certain allineation of the axes of the rotations
  produces what we call magnetism. In a steel bar not magnetized the little
  axes of rotation are all in different directions. The process <!-- Page
  112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>of
  magnetization is simply bringing these rotations to be more or less round
  parallel axes, an allineation of the axes. A honey-combed mass with a
  spinning gyrostat in every cell, with all the spinning axes parallel, and
  the spins in the same direction, would&mdash;I was about to say, would be
  a magnet, but it would not be a magnet in all its properties, and yet it
  would resemble a magnet in many ways.<a name="NtA11"

  <p>Some of you, seeing electromotors and other electric contrivances near
  this table, may think that they have to do with our theories and
  explanations of magnetic phenomena. But I must explain that this
  electromotor which I hold in my hand (Fig. 51) is used by me merely as
  the <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>most convenient means I could find for the
  spinning of my tops and gyrostats. On the spindle of the motor is
  fastened a circular piece of wood; by touching this key I can supply the
  motor with electric energy, and the wooden disc is now rotating very
  rapidly. I have only to bring its rim in contact with any of these tops
  or gyrostats to set them spinning, and you see that I can set half a
  dozen gyrostats a-spinning in a few seconds; this chain of gyrostats, for
  instance. Again, this larger motor (Fig. 52), too large to move about in
  my hand, is fastened to the table, and I have used <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>it to drive my larger
  contrivances; but you understand that I use these just as a barber might
  use them to brush your hair, or Sarah Jane to clean the knives, or just
  as I would use a little steam-engine if it were more convenient for my
  purpose. It was more convenient for me to bring from London this battery
  of accumulators and these motors than to bring sacks of coals, and
  boilers, and steam-engines. But, indeed, all this has the deeper meaning
  that we can give to it if we like. Love is as old as the hills, and every
  day Love's messages are carried by the latest servant of man, the
  telegraph. These spinning tops were known probably to primeval man, and
  yet we have not learnt from them more than the most fractional portion of
  the lesson that they are always sending out to an unobservant world. Toys
  like these were spun probably by the builders of the Pyramids when they
  were boys, and here you see them side by side with the very latest of
  man's contrivances. I feel almost as Mr. Stanley might feel if, with the
  help of the electric light and a magic-lantern, he described his
  experiences in that dreadful African forest to the usual company of a
  London drawing-room.</p>

  <p>The phenomena I have been describing to you play such a very important
  part in nature, that if time admitted I might go on expounding and <!--
  Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>explaining without finding any great
  reason to stop at one place rather than another. The time at my disposal
  allows me to refer to only one other matter, namely, the connection
  between light and magnetism and the behaviour of spinning tops.</p>

  <p>You are all aware that sound takes time to travel. This is a matter of
  common observation, as one can see a distant woodchopper lift his axe
  again before one hears the sound of his last stroke. A destructive sea
  wave is produced on the coast of Japan many hours after an earthquake
  occurs off the coast of America, the wave motion having taken time to
  travel across the Pacific. But although light travels more quickly than
  sound or wave motion in the sea, it does not travel with infinite
  rapidity, and the appearance of the eclipse of one of Jupiter's
  satellites is delayed by an observable number of minutes because light
  takes time to travel. The velocity has been measured by means of such
  observations, and we know that light travels at the rate of about 187,000
  miles per second, or thirty thousand millions of centimetres per second.
  There is no doubt about this figure being nearly correct, for the
  velocity of light has been measured in the laboratory by a perfectly
  independent method.</p>

  <p>Now the most interesting physical work done since Newton's time is the
  outcome of the experiments of Faraday and the theoretical deductions of
  <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>Thomson and Maxwell. It is the theory that
  light and radiant heat are simply electro-magnetic disturbances
  propagated through space. I dare not do more than just refer to this
  matter, although it is of enormous importance. I can only say, that of
  all the observed facts in the sciences of light, electricity, and
  magnetism, we know of none that is in opposition to Maxwell's theory, and
  we know of many that support it. The greatest and earliest support that
  it had was this. If the theory is correct, then a certain
  electro-magnetic measurement ought to result in exactly the same quantity
  as the velocity of light. Now I want you to understand that the electric
  measurement is one of quantities that seem to have nothing whatever to do
  with light, except that one uses one's eyes in making the measurement; it
  requires the use of a two-foot rule and a magnetic needle, and coils of
  wire and currents of electricity. It seemed to bear a relationship to the
  velocity of light, which was not very unlike the fabled connection
  between Tenterden Steeple and the Goodwin Sands. It is a measurement
  which it is very difficult to make accurately. A number of skilful
  experimenters, working independently, and using quite different methods,
  arrived at results only one of which is as much as five per cent.
  different from the observed velocity of light, and some of them, <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>on
  which the best dependence may be placed, agree exactly with the average
  value of the measurements of the velocity of light.</p>

  <p>There is then a wonderful agreement of the two measurements, but
  without more explanation than I can give you now, you cannot perhaps
  understand the importance of this agreement between two seemingly
  unconnected magnitudes. At all events we now know, from the work of
  Professor Hertz in the last two years, that Maxwell's theory is correct,
  and that light is an electro-magnetic disturbance; and what is more, we
  know that electro-magnetic disturbances, incomparably slower than
  red-light or heat, are passing now through our bodies; that this now
  recognized kind of radiation may be reflected and refracted, and yet will
  pass through brick and stone walls and foggy atmospheres where light
  cannot pass, and that possibly all military and marine and lighthouse
  signalling may be conducted in the future through the agency of this new
  and wonderful kind of radiation, of which what we call light is merely
  one form. Why at this moment, for all I know, two citizens of Leeds may
  be signalling to each other in this way through half a mile of houses,
  including this hall in which we are present.<a name="NtA12"
  href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span></p>

  <p>I mention this, the greatest modern philosophical discovery, because
  the germ of it, which was published by Thomson in 1856, makes direct
  reference to the analogy between the behaviour of our spinning-tops and
  magnetic and electrical phenomena. It will be easier, however, for us to
  consider here a mechanical illustration of the rotation of the plane of
  polarized light by magnetism which Thomson elaborated in 1874. This
  phenomenon may, I think, be regarded as the most important of all
  Faraday's discoveries. It was of enormous scientific importance, because
  it was made in a direction where a new phenomenon was not even suspected.
  Of his discovery of induced currents of electricity, to which all
  electric-lighting companies and transmission of power companies of the
  present day owe their being, Faraday himself said that it was a natural
  consequence of the discoveries of an earlier experimenter, Oersted. But
  this magneto-optic discovery was quite unexpected. I will now describe
  the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Some of you are aware that when a beam of light is sent through this
  implement, called a Nichol's Prism, it becomes polarized, or
  one-sided&mdash;that is, all the light that comes through is known to be
  propagated by vibrations which occur all in one plane. This rope (Fig.
  53) hanging from the ceiling <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>illustrates the nature of plane polarized
  light. All points in the rope are vibrating in the same plane. Well, this
  prism A, Fig. 54, only lets through it light that is polarized in a
  vertical plane. And here at B I have a similar implement, and I place it
  so that it also will only allow light to pass through it which is
  polarized in a vertical plane. Hence most of the light coming through the
  polarizer, as the first prism is called, will pass readily through the
  analyzer, as the second is called, and I am now letting this light enter
  my eye. But when I turn the analyzer round through a right angle, I find
  that I see no light; there was a gradual darkening as I rotated the
  analyzer. The analyzer will now only allow light to pass through which is
  polarized in a horizontal plane, and it receives no such light.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 54.</span>
  </div>

  <p>You will see in this model (Fig. 55) a good illustration of polarized
  light. The white, brilliantly illuminated thread M N is <!-- Page 120
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>{120}</span>pulled by a
  weight beyond the pulley M, and its end N is fastened to one limb of a
  tuning-fork. Some ragged-looking pieces of thread round the portion N A
  prevent its vibrating in any very determinate way, but from A to M the
  thread is free from all encumbrance. A vertical slot at A, through which
  the thread passes, determines the nature of the vibration of the part A
  B; every part of the thread between A and B is vibrating in up and down
  directions only. A vertical slot in B allows the vertical vibration to be
  communicated through it, and so we see the part B M vibrating in the same
  way as A B. I might point out quite a lot of ways in which this is not a
  perfect illustration of what occurs with light in Fig. 54. But it is
  quite good enough for my present purpose. A is a polarizer of vibration;
  it only allows up and down motion to pass through it, and B also allows
  up and down motion to pass through. But now, as B is turned round, it
  lets less and less of the up and down motion pass through it, until when
  it is in the second position shown in the lower part of the figure, it
  allows no up and down motion to pass through, and there is no visible
  motion of the thread between B and M. You will observe that if we did not
  know in what plane (in the present case the plane is vertical) the
  vibrations of the thread between A and B occurred, we should only have to
  turn B round until we found no vibration <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>passing through, to
  obtain the information. Hence, as in the light case, we may call A a
  polarizer of vibrations, and B an analyzer.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:69%;">
      <a href="images/fig55.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig55.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 55" title="Fig. 55" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 55.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Now if polarized light is passing from A to B (Fig. 54) through the
  air, say, and we have the analyzer placed so that there is darkness, we
  find that if we place in the path of the ray some solution of sugar we
  shall no longer have darkness at B; we must turn B round to get things
  dark again; this is evidence of the sugar solution having twisted round
  the plane of polarization of the light. I will now assume that you know
  something about what is meant by twisting the plane of polarization of
  light. You know that sugar solution will do it, and the longer the path
  of the ray through the sugar, the more twist it gets. This phenomenon is
  taken advantage of in the sugar industries, to find the strengths of
  sugar solutions. For the thread illustration I am indebted to Professor
  Silvanus Thomson, and the next piece of apparatus which I shall show also
  belongs to him.</p>

  <p>I have here (<i>see</i> Frontispiece) a powerful armour-clad coil, or
  electro-magnet. There is a central hole through it, through which a beam
  of light may be passed from an electric lamp, and I have a piece of
  Faraday's heavy glass nearly filling this hole. I have a polarizer at one
  end, and an analyzer at the other. You see now that the <!-- Page 123
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>polarized
  light passes through the heavy glass and the analyzer, and enters the eye
  of an observer. I will now turn B until the light no longer passes. Until
  now there has been no magnetism, but I have the means here of producing a
  most intense magnetic field in the direction in which the ray passes, and
  if your eye were here you would see that there is light passing through
  the analyzer. The magnetism has done something to the light, it has made
  it capable of passing where it could not pass before. When I turn the
  analyzer a little I stop the light again, and now I know that what the
  magnetism did was to convert the glass into a medium like the sugar, a
  medium which rotates the plane of polarization of light.</p>

  <p>In this experiment you have had to rely upon my personal measurement
  of the actual rotation produced. But if I insert between the polarizer
  and analyzer this disc of Professor Silvanus Thomson's, built up of
  twenty-four radial pieces of mica, I shall have a means of showing to
  this audience the actual rotation of the plane of polarization of light.
  You see now on the screen the light which has passed through the analyzer
  in the form of a cross, and if the cross rotates it is a sign of the
  rotation of the plane of polarization of the light. By means of this
  electric key I can create, destroy, and reverse the magnetic <!-- Page
  124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>field in
  the glass. As I create magnetism you see the twisting of the cross; I
  destroy the magnetism, and it returns to its old position; I create the
  opposite kind of magnetism, and you see that the cross twists in the
  opposite way. I hope it is now known to you that magnetism rotates the
  plane of polarization of light as the solution of sugar did.</p>

  <p>As an illustration of what occurs between polarizer and analyzer, look
  again at this rope (Fig. 53) fastened to the ceiling. I move the bottom
  end sharply from east to west, and you see that every part of the rope
  moves from east to west. Can you imagine a rope such that when the bottom
  end was moved from east to west, a point some yards up moved from
  east-north-east to west-sou'-west, that a higher point moved from
  north-east to south-west, and so on, the direction gradually changing for
  higher and higher points? Some of you, knowing what I have done, may be
  able to imagine it. We should have what we want if this rope were a chain
  of gyrostats such as you see figured in the diagram; gyrostats all
  spinning in the same way looked at from below, with frictionless hinges
  between them. Here is such a chain (Fig. 56), one of many that I have
  tried to use in this way for several years. But although I have often
  believed that I saw the phenomenon occur in <!-- Page 126 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>such a chain, I must
  now confess to repeated failures. The difficulties I have met with are
  almost altogether mechanical ones. You see that by touching all the
  gyrostats in succession with this rapidly revolving disc driven by the
  little electromotor, I can get them all to spin at the same time; but you
  will notice that what with bad mechanism and bad calculation on my part,
  and want of skill, the phenomenon is completely masked by wild movements
  of the gyrostats, the causes of which are better known than capable of
  rectification. The principle of the action is very visible in this
  gyrostat suspended as the bob of a pendulum (Fig. 57). You may imagine
  this to represent a particle of the <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>substance which
  transmits light in the magnetic field, and you see by the trickling thin
  stream of sand which falls from it on the paper that it is continually
  changing the plane of polarization. But I am happy to say that I can show
  you to-night a really successful illustration of Thomson's principle; it
  is the very first time that this most suggestive experiment has been
  shown to an audience. I have a number of double gyrostats (Fig. 58)
  placed on the same line, joined end to end by short pieces of elastic.
  Each instrument is supported at its centre of gravity, and it can rotate
  both in horizontal and in vertical planes.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:70%;">
      <a href="images/fig58.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig58.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 58" title="Fig. 58" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 58.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The end of the vibrating lever A can only get a horizontal motion from
  my hand, and the motion is transmitted from one gyrostat to the next,
  until it has travelled to the very end one. Observe that when the
  gyrostats are not spinning, the motion is <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span>everywhere horizontal.
  Now it is very important not to have any illustration here of a reflected
  ray of light, and so I have introduced a good deal of friction at all the
  supports. I will now spin all the gyrostats, and you will observe that
  when A moves nearly straight horizontally, the next gyrostat moves
  straight but in a slightly different plane, the second gyrostat moves in
  another plane, and so on, each gyrostat slightly twisting the plane in
  which the motion occurs; and you see that the end one does not by any
  means receive the horizontal motion of A, but a motion nearly vertical.
  This is a mechanical illustration, the first successful one I have made
  after many trials, of the effect on light of magnetism. The reason for
  the action that occurs in this model must be known to everybody who has
  tried to follow me from the beginning of the lecture.</p>

  <p>And you can all see that we have only to imagine that many particles
  of the glass are rotating like gyrostats, and that magnetism has
  partially caused an allineation of their axes, to have a dynamical theory
  of Faraday's discovery. The magnet twists the plane of polarization, and
  so does the solution of sugar; but it is found by experiment that the
  magnet does it indifferently for coming and going, whereas the sugar does
  it in a way that corresponds with a spiral structure of molecules. You
  see that in this important <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>particular the gyrostat analogue must
  follow the magnetic method, and not the sugar method. We must regard this
  model, then, the analogue to Faraday's experiment, as giving great
  support to the idea that magnetism consists of rotation.</p>

  <p>I have already exceeded the limits of time usually allowed to a
  popular lecturer, but you see that I am very far from having exhausted
  our subject. I am not quite sure that I have accomplished the object with
  which I set out. My object was, starting from the very different
  behaviour of a top when spinning and when not spinning, to show you that
  the observation of that very common phenomenon, and a determination to
  understand it, might lead us to understand very much more complex-looking
  things. There is no lesson which it is more important to learn than
  this&mdash;That it is in the study of every-day facts that all the great
  discoveries of the future lie. Three thousand years ago spinning tops
  were common, but people never studied them. Three thousand years ago
  people boiled water and made steam, but the steam-engine was unknown to
  them. They had charcoal and saltpetre and sulphur, but they knew nothing
  of gunpowder. They saw fossils in rocks, but the wonders of geology were
  unstudied by them. They had bits of iron and copper, but not one of them
  thought of any one of the fifty simple <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span>ways that are now known
  to us of combining those known things into a telephone. Why, even the
  simplest kind of signalling by flags or lanterns was unknown to them, and
  yet a knowledge of this might have changed the fate of the world on one
  of the great days of battle that we read about. We look on Nature now in
  an utterly different way, with a great deal more knowledge, with a great
  deal more reverence, and with much less unreasoning superstitious fear.
  And what we are to the people of three thousand years ago, so will be the
  people of one hundred years hence to us; for indeed the acceleration of
  the rate of progress in science is itself accelerating. The army of
  scientific workers gets larger and larger every day, and it is my belief
  that every unit of the population will be a scientific worker before
  long. And so we are gradually making time and space yield to us and obey
  us. But just think of it! Of all the discoveries of the next hundred
  years; the things that are unknown to us, but which will be so well known
  to our descendants that they will sneer at us as utterly ignorant,
  because these things will seem to them such self-evident facts; I say, of
  all these things, if one of us to-morrow discovered one of them, he would
  be regarded as a great discoverer. And yet the children of a hundred
  years hence will know it: it will be brought home to <!-- Page 131
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>them perhaps
  at every footfall, at the flapping of every coat-tail.</p>

  <p>Imagine the following question set in a school examination paper of
  2090 <span class="scac">A.D.</span>&mdash;"Can you account for the crass
  ignorance of our forefathers in not being able to see from England what
  their friends were doing in Australia?"<a name="NtA13"
  href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Or this&mdash;"Messages are being
  received every minute from our friends on the planet Mars, and are now
  being answered: how do you account for our ancestors being utterly
  ignorant that these messages were occasionally sent to them?" Or
  this&mdash;"What metal is as strong compared with steel as steel is
  compared with lead? and explain why the discovery of it was not made in
  Sheffield."</p>

  <p>But there is one question that our descendants will never ask in
  accents of jocularity, for to their bitter sorrow every man, woman, and
  child of them will know the answer, and that question is this&mdash;"If
  our ancestors in the matter of coal economy were not quite as ignorant as
  a baby who takes a penny <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>as equivalent for a half-crown, why did
  they waste our coal? Why did they destroy what never can be
  replaced?"</p>

  <p>My friends, let me conclude by impressing upon you the value of
  knowledge, and the importance of using every opportunity within your
  reach to increase your own store of it. Many are the glittering things
  that seem to compete successfully with it, and to exercise a stronger
  fascination over human hearts. Wealth and rank, fashion and luxury, power
  and fame&mdash;these fire the ambitions of men, and attract myriads of
  eager worshippers; but, believe it, they are but poor things in
  comparison with knowledge, and have no such pure satisfactions to give as
  those which it is able to bestow. There is no evil thing under the sun
  which knowledge, when wielded by an earnest and rightly directed will,
  may not help to purge out and destroy; and there is no man or woman born
  into this world who has not been given the capacity, not merely to gather
  in knowledge for his own improvement and delight, but even to add
  something, however little, to that general stock of knowledge which is
  the world's best wealth.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE USE OF GYROSTATS.</p>

  <p>In 1874 two famous men made a great mistake in endeavouring to prevent
  or diminish the rolling motion of the saloon of a vessel by using a
  rapidly rotating wheel. Mr. Macfarlane Gray pointed out their mistake. It
  is only when the wheel is allowed to <i>precess</i> that it can exercise
  a steadying effect; the moment which it then exerts is equal to the
  angular speed of the precession multiplied by the moment of momentum of
  the spinning wheel.</p>

  <p>It is astonishing how many engineers who know the laws of motion of
  mere translation, are ignorant of angular motion, and yet the analogies
  between the two sets of laws are perfectly simple. I have set out these
  analogies in my book on <i>Applied Mechanics</i>. The last of them
  between centripetal force on a body moving in a curved path, and torque
  or moment on a rotating body is the simple key to all gyrostatic or top
  calculation. When the spin of a top is greatly reduced it is necessary to
  remember that the total moment of momentum is not about the spinning axis
  (see my <i>Applied Mechanics</i>, page 594); correction for this is, I
  suppose, what introduces the complexity which scares students from
  studying the vagaries of tops; but in all cases that are likely to come
  before an engineer it would be absurd to study <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>such a small
  correction, and consequently calculation is exceedingly simple.</p>

  <p>Inventors using gyrostats have succeeded in doing the following
  things&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) Keeping the platform of a gun level on board ship, however the
  ship may roll or pitch. Keeping a submarine vessel or a flying machine
  with any plane exactly horizontal or inclined in any specified way.<a
  name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> It is easy to effect such
  objects without the use of a gyrostat, as by means of spirit levels it is
  possible to command powerful electric or other motors to keep anything
  always level. The actual methods employed by Mr. Beauchamp Tower (an
  hydraulic method), and by myself (an electric method), depend upon the
  use of a gyrostat, which is really a pendulum, the axis being
  vertical.</p>

  <p>(2) Greatly reducing the rolling (or pitching) of a ship, or the
  saloon of a ship. This is the problem which Mr. Schlick has solved with
  great success, at any rate in the case of torpedo boats.</p>

  <p>(3) In Mr. Brennan's Mono-rail railway, keeping the resultant force
  due to weight, wind pressure, centrifugal force, etc., exactly in line
  with the rail, so that, however the load on a wagon may alter in
  position, and although the wagon may be going round a curve, it is
  quickly brought to a position such that there are no forces tending to
  alter its angular position. The wagon leans over towards the wind or
  towards the centre of the curve of the rail so as to be in
  equilibrium.</p>

  <p>(4) I need not refer to such matters as the use of gyrostats for the
  correction of compasses on board ship, referred to in page <a
  href="#page111">111</a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span></p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span></p>

  <p>Problems (2) and (3) are those to which I wish to refer. For a ship of
  6,000 tons Mr. Schlick would use a large wheel of 10 to 20 tons,
  revolving about an axis E&nbsp;F (fig. 1) whose mean position is vertical. Its
  bearings are in a frame E&nbsp;C&nbsp;F&nbsp;D which can move about a thwart-ship axis
  C&nbsp;D with a precessional motion. Its centre of gravity is below this axis,
  so that like the ship itself the frame is in stable equilibrium. Let the
  ship have rolled through an angle R from its upright position, and
  suppose the axis E&nbsp;F to have precessed through the angle P from a
  vertical position. Let the angular velocity of rolling be called R<span
  class="x1"><span class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span>, and the angular
  velocity of precession P<span class="x1"><span
  class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span>; let the moment of momentum of the wheel
  be <i>m</i>. For any vibrating body like a ship it is easy to write out
  the equation of motion; into this equation we have merely to introduce
  the moment <i>m</i> P<span class="x1"><span
  class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span> diminishing R; into the equation for P
  we merely introduce the moment <i>m</i> R<span class="x1"><span
  class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span> increasing P. As usual we introduce
  frictional terms; in the first place F R<span class="x1"><span
  class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span> (F being a constant co-efficient)
  stilling the roll of the ship; in the second case <i>f</i> P<span
  class="x1"><span class="x7">&#x2D9;</span></span> a fluid friction
  introduced by a pair of dash pots applied at the pins A and B to still
  the precessional vibrations of the frame. It will be found that the
  angular motion P is very much greater than the roll R. Indeed, so great
  is P that there are stops to prevent its exceeding a certain amount. Of
  course so long as a stop acts, preventing precession, the roll of the
  ship proceeds as if the gyrostat wheel were not rotating. Mr. Schlick
  drives his wheels by steam; he will probably in future do as Mr. Brennan
  does, drive them by electromotors, and keep them in air-tight cases in
  good vacuums, because the loss of energy by friction against an
  atmosphere is proportional to the density of the atmosphere. The solution
  of the equations to find the nature of the R and P motions is sometimes
  tedious, but requires no great amount of mathematical knowledge. In a
  case considered by me of <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>a 6,000 ton ship, the period of a roll was
  increased from 14 to 20 seconds by the use of the gyrostat, and the roll
  rapidly diminished in amount. There was accompanying this slow periodic
  motion, one of a two seconds' period, but if it did appear it was damped
  out with great rapidity. Of course it is assumed that, by the use of
  bilge keels and rolling chambers, and as low a metacentre as is
  allowable, we have already lengthened the time of vibration, and damped
  the roll R as much as possible, before applying the gyrostat. I take it
  that everybody knows the importance of lengthening the period of the
  natural roll of a ship, although he may not know the reason. The reason
  why modern ships of great tonnage are so steady is because their natural
  periodic times of rolling vibration are so much greater than the probable
  periods of any waves of the sea, for if a series of waves acts upon a
  ship tending to make it roll, if the periodic time of each wave is not
  very different from the natural periodic time of vibration of the ship,
  the rolling motion may become dangerously great.</p>

  <p>If we try to apply Mr. Schlick's method to Mr. Brennan's car it is
  easy to show that there is instability of motion, whether there is or is
  not friction. If there is no friction, and we make the gyrostat frame
  unstable by keeping its centre of gravity above the axis C&nbsp;D, there will
  be vibrations, but the smallest amount of friction will cause these
  vibrations to get greater and greater. Even without friction there will
  be instability if <i>m</i>, the moment of momentum of the wheel, is less
  than a certain amount. We see, then, that no form of the Schlick method,
  or modification of it, can be applied to solve the Brennan problem.</p>

<p><!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Brennan's method of working is quite different from that of Mr.
  Schlick. Fig. 2 shows his model car (about six feet long); it is driven
  by electric accumulators carried by the car. His gyrostat wheels are
  driven by electromotors (not shown in fig. 3); as they are revolving in
  nearly vacuous spaces they consume but little power, and even if the
  current were stopped they would continue running at sufficiently high
  speeds to be effective for a length of time. Still it must not be
  forgotten that energy is wasted in friction, and work has to be done in
  bringing the car to a new position of equilibrium, and this energy is
  supplied by the electromotors. Should the gyrostats really stop, or fall
  to a certain low speed, two supports are automatically dropped, one on
  either side of the car; each of them drops till it reaches the ground;
  one of them dropping, perhaps, much farther than the other.</p>

  <p>The real full-size car, which he is now constructing, may be pulled
  with other cars by any kind of locomotive using electricity or petrol or
  steam, or each of the wheels may be a driving wheel. He would prefer to
  generate electropower on his train, and to drive every wheel with an
  electric motor. His wheels are so independent of one another that they
  can take very quick curves and vertical inequalities of the rail. The
  rail is fastened to sleepers lying on ground that may have sidelong
  slope. The model car is supported by a mono-rail bogie at each end; each
  bogie has two wheels pivoted both vertically and horizontally; it runs on
  a round iron gas pipe, and sometimes on steel wire rope; the ground is
  nowhere levelled or cut, and at one place the rail is a steel wire rope
  spanning a gorge, as shown in fig. 2. It is interesting to stop the car
  in the middle of this rope and to swing the rope sideways to see the
  automatic balancing of the car. The car may be left here or elsewhere
  balancing itself with nobody in charge of it. If the load on the
  car&mdash;great lead weights&mdash;be dumped about into new positions,
  the car adjusts itself to the new conditions with great <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>{144}</span>quickness.
  When the car is stopped, if a person standing on the ground pushes the
  car sidewise, the car of course pushes in opposition, like an indignant
  animal, and by judicious pushing and yielding it is possible to cause a
  considerable tilt. Left now to itself the car rights itself very
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic representation of Mr. Brennan's pair of
  gyrostats in sectional elevation and plan. The cases G and G', inside
  which the wheels F and F' are rotating <i>in vacuo</i> at the same speed
  and in opposite directions (driven by electromotors not shown in the
  figure), are pivoted about vertical axes E&nbsp;J and E'&nbsp;J'. They are
  connected by spur-toothed segments J&nbsp;J and J'&nbsp;J', so that their
  precessional motions are equal and opposite. The whole system is pivoted
  about C, a longitudinal axis. Thus when precessing so that H comes out of
  the paper, so will H', and when H goes into the paper, so does H'. When
  the car is in equilibrium the axes K&nbsp;H and K'&nbsp;H' are in line N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N'
  across the car in the plane of the paper. They are also in a line which
  is at right angles to the total resultant (vertical or nearly vertical)
  force on the car. I will call N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N' the mid position. Let ½<i>m</i>
  be the moment of momentum of either wheel. Let us suppose that suddenly
  the car finds that it is not in equilibrium because of a gust of wind, or
  centrifugal force, or an alteration of loading, so that the shelf D comes
  up against H, the spinning axis (or a roller revolving with the spinning
  axis) of the gyrostat. H begins to roll away from me, and if no slipping
  occurred (but there always is slipping, and, indeed, slipping is a
  necessary condition) it would roll, that is, the gyrostats would precess
  with a constant angular velocity <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>, and
  exert the moment <i>m</i><span class="grk">&alpha;</span> upon the shelf
  D, and therefore on the car. It is to be observed that this is greater as
  the diameter of the rolling part is greater. This precession continues
  until the roller and the shelf cease to touch. At first H lifts with the
  shelf, and afterwards the shelf moving downwards is followed for some
  distance by the roller. If the tilt had been in the opposite direction
  the shelf D' would have acted upwards upon the roller H', and caused just
  the opposite kind of precession, and a moment of the opposite kind.</p>

  <p>We now have the spindles out of their mid position; how are they
  brought back from O&nbsp;Q and O'&nbsp;Q' to O&nbsp;N and O'&nbsp;N', <!-- Page 147 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>but with H permanently
  lowered just the right amount? It is the essence of Mr. Brennan's
  invention that after a restoring moment has been applied to the car the
  spindles shall go back to the position N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N' (with H permanently
  lowered), so as to be ready to act again. He effects this object in
  various ways. Some ways described in his patents are quite different from
  what is used on the model, and the method to be used on the full-size
  wagon will again be quite different. I will describe one of the methods.
  Mr. Brennan tells me that he considers this old method to be crude, but
  he is naturally unwilling to allow me to publish his latest method.</p>

  <p>D' is a circular shelf extending from the mid position in my
  direction; D is a similar shelf extending from the mid position into the
  paper, or away from me. It is on these shelves that H' and H roll,
  causing precession away from N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N', as I have just described. When H'
  is inside the paper, or when H is outside the paper, they find no shelf
  to roll upon. There are, however, two other shelves L and L', for two
  other rollers M and M', which are attached to the frames concentric with
  the spindles; they are free to rotate, but are not rotated by the
  spindles. When they are pressed by their shelves L or L' this causes
  negative precession, and they roll towards the N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N' position. There
  is, of course, friction at their supports, retarding their rotation, and
  therefore the precession. The important thing to remember is that H and
  H', when they touch their shelves (when one is touching the other is not
  touching) cause a precession away from the mid position N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N' at a
  rate <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>, which produces a restoring moment
  <i>m</i><span class="grk">&alpha;</span> of nearly constant amount
  (except for slipping), whereas where M or M' touches its shelf L or L'
  (when one is touching the other is not touching) the pressure on the
  shelf and friction determine the rate of the precession towards the mid
  position N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N', <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>as well as the small vertical motion. The
  friction at the supports of M and M' is necessary.</p>

  <p>Suppose that the tilt from the equilibrium position to be corrected is
  R, when D presses H upward. The moment <i>m</i><span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>, and its time of action (the total momental
  impulse) are too great, and R is over-corrected; this causes the roller
  M' to act on L', and the spindles return to the mid position; they go
  beyond the mid position, and now the roller H' acts on D', and there is a
  return to the mid position, and beyond it a little, and so it goes on,
  the swings of the gyrostats out of and into the mid position, and the
  vibrations of the car about its position of equilibrium getting rapidly
  less and less until again neither H nor H', nor M nor M' is touching a
  shelf. It is indeed marvellous to see how rapidly the swings decay.
  Friction accelerates the precession away from N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N'. Friction retards
  the precession towards the middle position.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that by using the two gyrostats instead of one when
  there is a curve on the line, although the plane N&nbsp;O&nbsp;O'&nbsp;N' rotates, and
  we may say that the gyrostats precess, the tilting couples which they
  might exercise are equal and opposite. I do not know if Mr. Brennan has
  tried a single gyrostat, the mid position of the axis of the wheel being
  vertical, but even in this case a change of slope, or inequalities in the
  line, might make it necessary to have a pair.</p>

  <p>It is evident that this method of Mr. Brennan is altogether different
  in character from that of Mr. Schlick. Work is here actually done which
  must be supplied by the electromotors.</p>

  <p>One of the most important things to know is this: the Brennan model is
  wonderfully successful; the weight of the apparatus is not a large
  fraction of the weight of the wagon; will this also be the case with a
  car weighing 1,000 times as <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>much? The calculation is not difficult,
  but I may not give it here. If we assume that suddenly the wagon finds
  itself at the angle R from its position of equilibrium, it may be taken
  that if the size of each dimension of the wagon be multiplied by
  <i>n</i>, and the size of each dimension of the apparatus be multiplied
  by <i>p</i>, then for a sudden gust of wind, or suddenly coming on a
  curve, or a sudden shift of position of part of the cargo, R may be taken
  as inversely proportional to <i>n</i>. I need not state the reasonable
  assumption which underlies this calculation, but the result is that if
  <i>n</i> is 10, <i>p</i> is 7.5. That is, if the weight of the wagon is
  multiplied by 1,000, the weight of the apparatus is only multiplied by
  420. In fact, if, in the model, the weight of the apparatus is 10 per
  cent. of that of the wagon, in the large wagon the weight of the
  apparatus is only about 4 per cent. of that of the wagon. This is a very
  satisfactory result.<a name="NtA15" href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>My calculations seem to show that Mr. Schlick's apparatus will form a
  larger fraction of the whole weight of a ship, as the ship is larger, but
  in the present experimental stage of the subject it is unfair to say more
  than that this seems probable. My own opinion is that large ships are
  sufficiently steady already.</p>

  <p>In both cases it has to be remembered that if the <i>diameter</i> of
  the wheel can be increased in greater proportion than the dimensions of
  ship or wagon, the proportional weight of the apparatus may be
  diminished. A wheel of twice the diameter, but of the same weight, may
  have twice the moment of momentum, and may therefore be twice as
  effective. I assume the stresses in the material to be the same.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX II.</h3>

  <p>Page <a href="#page23">23</a>; note at line 3. Prof. Osborne Reynolds
  made the interesting remark (<i>Collected Papers</i>, Vol. ii., p. 154),
  "That if solid matter had certain kinds of internal motions, such as the
  box has, pears differing, say, from apples, the laws of motion would not
  have been discovered; if discovered for pears they would not have applied
  to <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'applies'."
  >apples</span>."</p>

  <p>Page <a href="#page38">38</a>; note at line 8. The motion of a rifle
  bullet is therefore one of precession about the tangent to the path. The
  mathematical solution is difficult, but Prof. Greenhill has satisfied
  himself mathematically that air friction damps the precession, and causes
  the axis of the shot to get nearer the tangential direction, so that fig.
  10 illustrates what would occur in a vacuum, but not in air. It is
  probable that this statement applies only to certain proportions of
  length to diameter.</p>

  <p>Page <a href="#page129">129</a>; note at line 5. Many men wonder how
  the ether can have the enormous rigidity necessary for light
  transmission, and yet behave like a frictionless fluid. One way of seeing
  how this may occur is to imagine that when ordinary matter moves in the
  ether it only tends to produce motion of translation of the ether
  particles, and therefore no resistance. But anything such as light, which
  must operate in turning axes of rotating parts, may encounter enormous
  elastic resistance.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt1" href="#NtA1">[1]</a> The <i>Operatives' Lecture</i> is
  always well advertised in the streets beforehand by large posters.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2" href="#NtA2">[2]</a> Bulwer Lytton's <i>Coming
  Race</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt3" href="#NtA3">[3]</a> The glass vessel ought to be
  broader in comparison with its height.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4" href="#NtA4">[4]</a> In 1746 Benjamin Robins taught the
  principles of rifling as we know them now. He showed that the <i>spin</i>
  of the round bullet was the most important thing to consider. He showed
  that even the bent barrel of a gun did not deflect the bullet to anything
  like the extent that the spin of the bullet made it deflect in the
  opposite direction.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5" href="#NtA5">[5]</a> <span
  class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;In Fig. 16 the axis is shown inclined, but,
  only that it would have been more troublesome to illustrate, I should
  have preferred to show the precession occurring when the axis keeps
  horizontal.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6" href="#NtA6">[6]</a> When this lecture containing the
  above statement was in the hands of the printers, I was directed by Prof.
  Fitzgerald to the late Prof. Jellet's <i>Treatise on the Theory of
  Friction</i>, published in 1872, and there at page 18 I found the
  mathematical explanation of the rising of a top.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7" href="#NtA7">[7]</a> Roughly, the <i>Inertia</i> or
  <i>Mass</i> of a body expresses its resistance to change of mere
  translational velocity, whereas, the <i>Moment of Inertia</i> of a body
  expresses its resistance to change of rotational velocity.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8" href="#NtA8">[8]</a> It is a very unlikely, and
  certainly absurd-looking, hypothesis, but it seems that it is not
  contradicted by any fact in spectrum analysis, or even by any probable
  theory of the constitution of the interstellar ether, that the stars are
  merely images of our own sun formed by reflection at the boundaries of
  the ether.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt9" href="#NtA9">[9]</a> Sir William Thomson has performed
  this.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt10" href="#NtA10">[10]</a> It must be remembered that in
  one case I speak of the true north, and in the other of the magnetic
  north.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt11" href="#NtA11">[11]</a> Rotating a large mass of iron
  rapidly in one direction and then in the other in the neighbourhood of a
  delicately-suspended magnetic needle, well protected from air currents,
  ought, I think, to give rise to magnetic phenomena of very great interest
  in the theory of magnetism. I have hitherto failed to obtain any trace of
  magnetic action, but I attribute my failure to the comparatively slow
  speed of rotation which I have employed, and to the want of delicacy of
  my magnetometer.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt12" href="#NtA12">[12]</a> I had applied for a patent for
  this system of signalling some time before the above words were spoken,
  but although it was valid I allowed it to lapse in pure shame that I
  should have so unblushingly patented the use of the work of Fitzgerald,
  Hertz, and Lodge.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt13" href="#NtA13">[13]</a> How to see by electricity is
  perfectly well known, but no rich man seems willing to sacrifice the few
  thousands of pounds which are necessary for making the apparatus. If I
  could spare the money and time I would spend them in doing this
  thing&mdash;that is, I think so&mdash;but it is just possible that if I
  could afford to throw away three thousand pounds, I might feel greater
  pleasure in the growth of a great fortune than in any other natural
  process.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt14" href="#NtA14">[14]</a> Probably first described by Mr.
  Brennan.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt15" href="#NtA15">[15]</a> The weight of Mr. Brennan's
  loaded wagon is 313 lb., including gyrostats and storage cells. His two
  wheels weigh 13 lb. If made of nickel steel and run at their highest safe
  speed they would weigh much less.</p>
